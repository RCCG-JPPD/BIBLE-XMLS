And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament [the expanse of the sky] in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters [below] from the waters [above].</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">And God made the firmament [the expanse] and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse. And it was so.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heavens. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be collected into one place [of standing], and let the dry land appear. And it was so.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">God called the dry land Earth, and the accumulated waters He called Seas. And God saw that this was good  and He approved it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth put forth [tender] vegetation: plants yielding seed and fruit trees yielding fruit whose seed is in itself, each according to its kind, upon the earth. And it was so.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed according to their own kinds and trees bearing fruit in which was their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good  and He approved it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be signs and tokens [of God&#8217;s provident care], and [to mark] seasons, days, and years,</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">And let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light upon the earth.

And God saw that it was good  and He approved it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply in the earth.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creeping things, and [wild] beasts of the earth according to their kinds. And it was so.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">And God made the [wild] beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and domestic animals according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good  and He approved it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="26">God said, Let Us [Father, Son, and Holy Spirit] make mankind in Our image, after Our likeness, and let them have complete authority over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the [tame] beasts, and over all of the earth, and over everything that creeps upon the earth.</VERS><VERS vnumber="27">So God created man in His own image, in the image and likeness of God He created him; male and female He created them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them and said to them, Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it [using all its vast resources in the service of God and man]; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and over every living creature that moves upon the earth.</VERS><VERS vnumber="29">And God said, See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the land and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.</VERS><VERS vnumber="30">And to all the animals on the earth and to every bird of the air and to everything that creeps on the ground&#8212;to everything in which there is the breath of life&#8212;I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.</VERS><VERS vnumber="31">And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good  and He approved it completely.

And he [Satan] said to the woman, Can it really be that God has said, You shall not eat from every tree of the garden?</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden,</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">Except the fruit from the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">But the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing the difference between good and evil and blessing and calamity.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good  for food and that it was delightful to look at, and a tree to be desired in order to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she gave some also to her husband, and he ate.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apronlike girdles.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">But the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, Where are you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">He said, I heard the sound of You [walking] in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me&#8212;she gave me [fruit] from the tree, and I ate.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">And the Lord God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled  me, and I ate.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all [domestic] animals and above every [wild] living thing of the field; upon your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust [and what it contains] all the days of your life.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her [a]Offspring; He will bruise and tread your head underfoot, and you will lie in wait and bruise His heel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">To the woman He said, I will greatly multiply your grief and your suffering in pregnancy and the pangs of childbearing; with spasms of distress you will bring forth children. Yet your desire and craving will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And to Adam He said, Because you have listened and given heed to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it, the ground is under a curse because of you; in sorrow and toil shall you eat [of the fruits] of it all the days of your life.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you shall return.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">The man called his wife&#8217;s name Eve [life spring], because she was the mother of all the living.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">For Adam also and for his wife the Lord God made long coats  of skins and clothed them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">And the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become like one of Us [the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit], to know [how to distinguish between] good and evil and blessing and calamity; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live [b]forever&#8212;</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">So [God] drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the [c]cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep and guard the way to the tree of life.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="4"><VERS vnumber="1">4&#160;And Adam knew Eve as his wife, and she became pregnant and bore Cain; and she said, I have gotten and gained a man with the help of the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">And [next] she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">And in the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">And Abel brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat portions. And the Lord had respect and regard for Abel and for his offering,</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">But for [a]Cain and his offering He had no respect or regard. So Cain was exceedingly angry and indignant, and he looked sad and depressed.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">And the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why do you look sad and depressed and dejected?</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at your door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">And Cain said to his brother, [b]Let us go out to the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">And [the Lord] said, What have you done? The voice of your brother&#8217;s blood is crying to Me from the ground.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">And now you are cursed by reason of the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&#8217;s [shed] blood from your hand.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth [in perpetual exile, a degraded outcast].</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">Then Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is [c]greater than I can bear.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the land, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">And the Lord said to him, [d]Therefore, if anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a [e]mark or sign upon Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">So Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod [wandering], east of Eden.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And Cain&#8217;s wife [one of Adam&#8217;s offspring] became pregnant and bore Enoch; and Cain built a [f]city and named it after his son Enoch.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methusael, and Methusael the father of Lamech.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah and of the other was Zillah.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle and purchase possessions.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">His brother&#8217;s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all [cutting] instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say; for I have slain a man [merely] for wounding me, and a young man [only] for striking and bruising me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech [will be avenged] seventy-sevenfold.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">And Adam&#8217;s wife again became pregnant, and she bore a son and called his name Seth. For God, she said, has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth also a son was born, whom he named Enosh.

Yes, and he shall be blessed.</VERS><VERS vnumber="34">When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with a great and bitter cry and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father!</VERS><VERS vnumber="35">[Isaac] said, Your brother came with crafty cunning and treacherous deceit and has taken your blessing.</VERS><VERS vnumber="36">[Esau] replied, Is he not rightly named Jacob [the supplanter]? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing! Have you not still a blessing reserved for me?</VERS><VERS vnumber="37">And Isaac answered Esau, Behold, I have made [Jacob] your lord and master; I have given all his brethren to him for servants, and with corn and [new] wine have I sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?</VERS><VERS vnumber="38">Esau said to his father, Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father! And Esau lifted up [could not control] his voice and wept aloud.</VERS><VERS vnumber="39">Then Isaac his father answered, Your [blessing and] dwelling shall all come from the fruitfulness of the earth and from the dew of the heavens above;</VERS><VERS vnumber="40">By your sword you shall live and serve your brother. But [the time shall come] when you will grow restive and break loose, and you shall tear his yoke from off your neck.</VERS><VERS vnumber="41">And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are very near. When [he is gone] I will [a]kill my brother Jacob.</VERS><VERS vnumber="42">These words of Esau her elder son were repeated to Rebekah.

This is none other than the house of God, and [a]this is the gateway to heaven!</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone he had put under his head, and he set it up for a pillar , and he poured oil on its top [in dedication].</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">And he named that place Bethel [the house of God]; but the name of that city was Luz at first.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Then Jacob made a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me food to eat and clothing to wear,</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">So that I may come again to my father&#8217;s house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God;</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">And this stone which I have set up as a pillar  shall be God&#8217;s house [a sacred place to me], and of all [the increase of possessions] that You give me I will give the tenth to You.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="29"><VERS vnumber="1">29&#160;Then Jacob went [briskly and cheerfully] on his way [400 miles] and came to the land of the people of the East.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">As he looked, he saw a well in the field; and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it, for out of that well the flocks were watered.

For he sold us and has also quite devoured our money [the price you paid for us].</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">For all the riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our children&#8217;s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And he drove away all his livestock and all his gain which he had gotten, the livestock he had obtained and accumulated in Padan-aram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep [possibly to the feast of sheepshearing], and Rachel stole her father&#8217;s household gods.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">And Jacob outwitted Laban the Syrian [Aramean] in that he did not tell him that he [intended] to flee and slip away secretly.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">So he fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the river [Euphrates] and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">But on the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">So he took his kinsmen with him and pursued after [Jacob] for seven days, and they overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">But God came to Laban the Syrian [Aramean] in a dream by night and said to him, Be careful that you do not speak from good to bad to Jacob [peaceably, then violently].</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">Then Laban overtook Jacob.

For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen [the images].</VERS><VERS vnumber="33">So Laban went into Jacob&#8217;s tent and into Leah&#8217;s tent and the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them.

What is my sin, that you so hotly pursued me?</VERS><VERS vnumber="37">Although you have searched and felt through all my household possessions, what have you found of all your household goods? Put it here before my brethren and yours, that they may judge and decide between us.</VERS><VERS vnumber="38">These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not lost their young, and the rams of your flock have not been eaten by me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="39">I did not bring you [the carcasses of the animals] torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss of it; you required of me [to make good] all that was stolen, whether it occurred by day or by night.</VERS><VERS vnumber="40">This was [my lot]; by day the heat consumed me and by night the cold, and I could not sleep.</VERS><VERS vnumber="41">I have been twenty years in your house.

So Tamar went and lived in her father&#8217;s house.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">But later Judah&#8217;s wife, the daughter of Shuah, died; and when Judah was comforted, he went up to his sheepshearers at Timnath with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">Then it was told Tamar, Listen, your father-in-law is going up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">So she put off her widow&#8217;s garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapped herself up [in disguise], and sat in the entrance of Enaim, which is by the road to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown and she was not given to him as his wife.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot or devoted prostitute [under a vow to her goddess], for she had covered her face [as such women did].</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">He turned to her by the road and said, Come, let me have intercourse with you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.

Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside a post of the temple  of the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">And [Hannah] was in distress of soul, praying to the Lord and weeping bitterly.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">She vowed, saying, O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your handmaid and [earnestly] remember, and not forget Your handmaid but will give me a son, I will give him to the Lord all his life; no razor shall touch his head.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli noticed her mouth.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">Eli said to her, How long will you be intoxicated? Put wine away from you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">But Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I was pouring out my soul before the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">Regard not your handmaid as a wicked woman; for out of my great complaint and bitter provocation I have been speaking.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">Then Eli said, Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">Hannah said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So [she] went her way and ate, her countenance no longer sad.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">The family rose early the next morning, worshiped before the Lord, and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Hannah became pregnant and in due time bore a son and named him Samuel [heard of God], Because, she said, I have asked him of the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">And Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there as long as he lives.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word. So Hannah remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">When she had [a]weaned him, she took him with her, with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin bottle of wine [to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet odor], and brought Samuel to the Lord&#8217;s house in Shiloh. The child was growing.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">Then they slew the bull, and brought the child to Eli.</VERS><VERS vnumber="26">Hannah said, Oh, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here praying to the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="27">For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted my petition made to Him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="28">Therefore I have given him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is given to the Lord. And they worshiped the Lord there.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="2"><VERS vnumber="1">2&#160;Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exults and triumphs in the Lord; my horn  is lifted up in the Lord.

But the child ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">The sons of Eli were base and worthless; they did not know or regard the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">And the custom of the priests with the people was this: when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&#8217;s servant came while the flesh was boiling with a fleshhook of three prongs in his hand;</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">And he thrust it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh with all the Israelites who came there.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Also, before they burned the fat, the priest&#8217;s servant came and said to the man who sacrificed, Give the priest meat to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">And if the man said to him, Let them burn the fat first, and then you may take as much as you want, the priest&#8217;s servant would say, No!

And he went to Eli and said, Here I am, for you did call me. Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">So Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down. And if He calls you, you shall say, Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">And the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, Samuel! Samuel! Then Samuel answered, Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">The Lord told Samuel, Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of all who hear it shall tingle.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">On that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">And I [now] announce to him that I will judge and punish his house forever for the iniquity of which he knew, for his sons were bringing a curse upon themselves [blaspheming God], and he did not restrain them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&#8217;s house shall not be atoned for or purged with sacrifice or offering forever.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the Lord&#8217;s house. And [he] was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">But Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here I am.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">Eli said, What is it He told you? Pray do not hide it from me. May God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that He said to you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing. And Eli said, It is the Lord; let Him do what seems good to Him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Samuel grew; the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of the Lord.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="4"><VERS vnumber="1">4&#160;And the word of [the Lord through] Samuel came to all Israel.

These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every kind of plague in the wilderness.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O you Philistines, that you may not become servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you; behave yourselves like men, and fight!</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">And the Philistines fought; Israel was smitten and they fled every man to his own home. There was a very great slaughter; for 30,000 foot soldiers of Israel fell.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.

When the man told the news in the city, all the city [people] cried out.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What is this uproar? And the man came hastily and told Eli.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Now Eli was 98 years old; his eyes were dim so that he could not see.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">The man said to Eli, I have come from the battle; I fled from the battle today. Eli said, How did it go, my son?</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">The messenger replied, Israel fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is captured.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And when he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate.

He was a head taller than any of the people.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">The donkeys of Kish, Saul&#8217;s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul, Take a servant with you and go, look for the donkeys.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">And they passed through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they went through the land of Shaalim and the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">And when they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, Come, let us return, lest my father stop worrying about the donkeys and become concerned about us.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">The servant said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, a man held in honor; all that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can show us where we should go.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what shall we bring the man? The bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no gift for the man of God. What have we?</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">The servant replied, I have here a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God to tell us our way&#8212;</VERS><VERS vnumber="9" /><VERS vnumber="10">Saul said to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">As they went up the hill to the city, they met young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">They answered, He is; behold, he is just beyond you. Hurry, for he came today to the city because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">As you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes to ask the blessing on the sacrifice. Afterward, those who are invited eat. So go on up, for about now you will find him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">So they went up to the city, and as they were entering, behold, Samuel came toward them, going up to the high place.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Now a day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed to Samuel in his ear,</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be leader over My people Israel; and he shall save them out of the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon the distress of My people, because their cry has come to Me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told him, There is the man of whom I told you. He shall have authority over My people.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">Then Saul came near to Samuel in the gate and said, Tell me where is the seer&#8217;s house?</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Samuel answered Saul, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be thinking about them, for they are found. And for whom are all the desirable things of Israel? Are they not for you and for all your father&#8217;s house?</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">And Saul said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the least of all the families of the clans of Benjamin? Why then do you speak this way to me?</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the guest room [at the high place] and had them sit in the chief place among the persons&#8212;about thirty of them&#8212;who were invited. [The other people feasted outside.]</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it aside.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">And the cook lifted high the shoulder and what was on it [indicating that it was the priest&#8217;s honored portion] and set it before Saul. [Samuel] said, See what was reserved for you. Eat, for until the hour appointed it was kept for you, ever since I invited the people. So Saul ate that day with Samuel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">When they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel conversed with Saul on the top of the house.</VERS><VERS vnumber="26">They arose early and about dawn Samuel called Saul [who was sleeping] on the top of the house, saying, Get up, that I may send you on your way. Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out on the street.</VERS><VERS vnumber="27">And as they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us&#8212;and he passed on&#8212;but you stand still, first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="10"><VERS vnumber="1">0&#160;Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it on Saul&#8217;s head and kissed him and said, Has not the Lord anointed you to be prince over His heritage Israel?</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">When you have left me today, you will meet two men by Rachel&#8217;s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, The donkeys you sought are found. And your father has quit caring about them and is anxious for you, asking, What shall I do about my son?</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">Then you will go on from there and you will come to the oak of Tabor, and three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin bottle of wine.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and when you come to the city, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">Then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you mightily, and you will show yourself to be a prophet with them; and you will be turned into another man.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">When these signs meet you, do whatever you find to be done, for God is with you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you shall do.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">And when [Saul] had turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all these signs came to pass that day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">When they came to the hill [Gibeah], behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he spoke under divine inspiration among them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">And when all who knew Saul before saw that he spoke by inspiration among the [schooled] prophets, the people said one to another, What has come over [him, who is nobody but] the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">One from that same place answered, But who is the father of the others? So it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">When [Saul] had ended his inspired speaking, he went to the high place.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">Saul&#8217;s uncle said to him and to his servant, Where did you go? And Saul said, To look for the donkeys, and when we found them nowhere, we went to Samuel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Saul&#8217;s uncle said, Tell me, what did Samuel say to you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel spoke he told him nothing.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And Samuel called the people together to the Lord at Mizpah</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And said to the Israelites, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: It was I Who brought up Israel out of Egypt and delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">But you have this day rejected your God, Who Himself saves you from all your calamities and distresses; and you have said to Him, No! Set a king over us. So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken [probably by lot].</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken. And Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he could not be found.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">Therefore they inquired of the Lord further, if the man would yet come back. And the Lord answered, Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">They ran and brought him from there.

And behold, I must die.</VERS><VERS vnumber="44">Saul answered, May God do so, and more also, for you shall surely die, Jonathan.</VERS><VERS vnumber="45">But the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan, who has wrought this great deliverance to Israel, die? God forbid! As the Lord lives, there shall not one hair of his head perish, for he has wrought this great deliverance with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.</VERS><VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul ceased pursuing the Philistines, and they went to their own place.</VERS><VERS vnumber="47">When Saul took over the kingdom of Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he made it worse for them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="48">He did valiantly and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="49">Now Saul&#8217;s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were, of the firstborn, Merab; and of the younger, Michal.</VERS><VERS vnumber="50">The name of Saul&#8217;s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul&#8217;s uncle.</VERS><VERS vnumber="51">Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="52">There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul, and whenever Saul saw any mighty or [outstandingly] courageous man, he attached him to himself.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="15"><VERS vnumber="1">5&#160;Samuel told Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now listen and heed the words of the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">Thus says the Lord of hosts, I have considered and will punish what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way when [Israel] came out of Egypt.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">So Saul assembled the men and numbered them at Telaim&#8212;200,000 men on foot and 10,000 men of Judah.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">And Saul came to the city of Amalek and laid wait in the valley.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">Saul warned the Kenites, Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">And he took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, though he utterly destroyed all the rest of the people with the sword.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, oxen, fatlings, lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but all that was undesirable or worthless they destroyed utterly.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">I regret making Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not performed My commands.

I have performed what the Lord ordered.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">And Samuel said, What then means this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but the rest we have utterly destroyed.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop! I will tell you what the Lord said to me tonight. Saul said to him, Say on.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">Samuel said, When you were small in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed you king over Israel?</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And the Lord sent you on a mission and said, Go, utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites; and fight against them until they are consumed.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord, but swooped down upon the plunder and did evil in the Lord&#8217;s sight?</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag king of Amalek and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">But the people took from the spoil sheep and oxen, the chief of the things to be utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">Samuel said, Has the Lord as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim . Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He also has rejected you from being king.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">Now, I pray you, pardon my sin and go back with me, that I may worship the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="26">And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="27">And as Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of Samuel&#8217;s mantle, and it tore.</VERS><VERS vnumber="28">And Samuel said to him, The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="29">And also the Strength of Israel will not lie or repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent.</VERS><VERS vnumber="30">Saul said, I have sinned; yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the Lord your God.</VERS><VERS vnumber="31">So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="32">Then Samuel said, Bring here to me Agag king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</VERS><VERS vnumber="33">Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.</VERS><VERS vnumber="34">Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.</VERS><VERS vnumber="35">And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, though Samuel grieved over Saul.

For the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said, Neither has the Lord chosen this one.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesse made Shammah pass by.

But truly as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever you desire, I will do for you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">David said to Jonathan, Tomorrow is the New Moon [festival], and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">If your father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">If he says, All right, then it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought [me] into a covenant of the Lord with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">And Jonathan said, Far be it from you! If I knew that evil was determined for you by my father, would I not tell you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">Then said David to Jonathan, Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">Jonathan said, Come, let us go into the field. So they went into the field.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">Jonathan said to David, The Lord, the God of Israel, be witness. When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well inclined toward David, and I do not send and let you know it,</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">The Lord do so, and much more, to Jonathan. But if it please my father to do you harm, then I will disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And may the Lord be with you as He has been with my father.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">While I am still alive you shall not only show me the loving-kindness of the Lord, so that I die not,</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever&#8212;no, not even when the Lord has cut off every enemy of David from the face of the earth.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, And the Lord will require that this covenant be kept at the hands of David&#8217;s enemies.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And Jonathan caused David to swear again by his love for him, for Jonathan loved him as he loved his own life.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the New Moon festival; and you will be missed, for your seat will be empty.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">On the third day you will go quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">And I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them&#8212;then you are to come, for it is safe for you and there is no danger, as the Lord lives.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">But if I say to the youth, Look, the arrows are beyond you&#8212;then go, for the Lord has sent you away.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">And as touching the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the Lord is between you and me forever.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">So David hid himself in the field, and when the New Moon [festival] came, the king sat down to eat food.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">The king sat, as at other times, on his seat by the wall, and Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul&#8217;s side, but David&#8217;s place was empty.</VERS><VERS vnumber="26">Yet Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him and he is not clean&#8212;surely he is not clean.</VERS><VERS vnumber="27">But on the morrow, the second day after the new moon, David&#8217;s place was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?</VERS><VERS vnumber="28">And Jonathan answered, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.</VERS><VERS vnumber="29">He said, Let me go, I pray, for our family holds a sacrifice in the city and my brother commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers. That is why he has not come to the king&#8217;s table.</VERS><VERS vnumber="30">Then Saul&#8217;s anger was kindled against Jonathan and he said to him, You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother who bore you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="31">For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, you shall not be established nor shall your kingdom. So now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</VERS><VERS vnumber="32">Jonathan answered Saul his father, Why should he be killed? What has he done?</VERS><VERS vnumber="33">But Saul cast his spear at him to smite him, by which Jonathan knew that his father had determined to kill David.</VERS><VERS vnumber="34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food that second day of the month, for he grieved for David because his father had disgraced him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="35">In the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad was with him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="36">And he said to his lad, Run, find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="37">When the lad came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called to [him], Is not the arrow beyond you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="38">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not! The lad gathered up the arrow and came to his master.</VERS><VERS vnumber="39">But the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS><VERS vnumber="40">Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and told him, Go, carry them to the city.</VERS><VERS vnumber="41">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose from beside the heap of stones and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another until David got control of himself.</VERS><VERS vnumber="42">And Jonathan told David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be between me and you, and between my descendants and yours forever. And Jonathan arose and departed into the city.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="21"><VERS vnumber="1">2&#160;Then David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech was afraid at meeting David, and said to him, Why are you alone and no man with you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has charged me with a matter and has told me, Let no man know anything of the mission on which I send you and with what I have charged you. I have appointed the young men to a certain place.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">Now what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you may have.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">And the priest answered David, There is no common bread on hand, but there is hallowed bread&#8212;if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">And David told the priest, Truly women have been kept from us in these three days since I came out, and the food bags and utensils of the young men are clean, and although the bread will be used in a secular way, it will be set apart in the clean bags.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread which was taken from before the Lord to put hot bread in its place the day when it was taken away.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Now a certain man of Saul&#8217;s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul&#8217;s herdsmen.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">David said to Ahimelech, Do you have at hand a sword or spear? The king&#8217;s business required haste, and I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the Valley of Elah, see, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, do so, for there is no other here. And David said, There is none like that; give it to me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">David arose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">The servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David, the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in their dances: Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish king of Gath.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">And he changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be insane in their [Philistine] hands, and scribbled on the gate doors, and drooled on his beard.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">Then said Achish to his servants, You see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Have I need of madmen, that you bring this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="22"><VERS vnumber="1">22&#160;So David departed and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father&#8217;s house heard it, they went down there to him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">And everyone in distress or in debt or discontented gathered to him, and he became a commander over them. And there were with him about 400 men.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father [of Moabite descent] and my mother, I pray you, come out [of Judah] and be with you till I know what God will do for me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold [in Moab].</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">Then the prophet Gad said to David, Do not remain in the stronghold; leave, and get into the land of Judah. So David left and went into the forest of Hareth.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height, his spear in his hand and all his servants standing about him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds,</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">That all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait, as he does this day?</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood with Saul&#8217;s servants, said, I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">And [Ahimelech] inquired of the Lord for him, and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&#8217;s house, the priests who were at Nob, and they all came to the king.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. He replied, Here I am, my lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so he could rise against me to lie in wait, as he does this day?</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">Then Ahimelech answered the king, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, who is the king&#8217;s son-in-law, and is taken into your council and honored in your house?</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">Have I only today begun inquiring of God for him? No! Let not the king impute any wrong to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, little or much.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">[Saul] said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&#8217;s house.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And the king said to the guard that stood about him, Turn and slay the Lord&#8217;s priests, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands against the Lord&#8217;s priests.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">The king said to Doeg, You turn and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests and slew that day eighty-five persons who wore the priest&#8217;s linen ephod.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the sword; both men and women, children and sucklings, oxen and donkeys and sheep, he put to the sword.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">And one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub named Abiathar escaped and fled after David.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the Lord&#8217;s priests.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul.

And the Lord said to David, Go, smite the Philistines and save Keilah.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">David&#8217;s men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more, then, if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">Then David inquired of the Lord again. And the Lord answered him, Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines with a great slaughter and brought away their cattle. So David delivered the people of Keilah.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">When Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came with an ephod in his hand.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand, for he is shut in by going into a town that has gates and bars.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">Saul summoned all the men for war, to go to Keilah to besiege David and his men.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod here.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">Then David said, O Lord, the God of Israel, Your servant has surely heard that Saul intends to come and destroy the city of Keilah on my account.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord, God of Israel, I beseech You, tell Your servant.

The Lord said, They will deliver you up.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">Then David and his men, about 600, arose and left Keilah, going wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up going there.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">David remained in the wilderness strongholds in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hands.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life.

For the Lord has returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him as his wife.</VERS><VERS vnumber="40">And when the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, David sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife.</VERS><VERS vnumber="41">And she arose and bowed herself to the earth and said, Behold, let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="42">And Abigail hastened and arose and rode on a donkey, with five of her maids who followed her, and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife.</VERS><VERS vnumber="43">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.</VERS><VERS vnumber="44">Saul had given Michal his daughter, David&#8217;s wife, to Phalti son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="26"><VERS vnumber="1">26&#160;The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself on the hill of Hachilah, east of Jeshimon?</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">So Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, with 3,000 chosen men of Israel, to seek David [there].</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. And when he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">David sent out spies and learned that Saul had actually come.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and saw where Saul lay with Abner son of Ner, commander of his army; and Saul was lying in the encampment, with the army encamped around him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, Who will go down with me into the camp of Saul? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there Saul lay sleeping within the encampment with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the army lay round about him.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">Then said Abishai to David, God has given your enemy into your hands this day. Now therefore let me smite him to the earth at once with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him; for who can raise his hand against the Lord&#8217;s anointed and be guiltless?</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">David said, As the Lord lives, [He] will smite him; or his day will come to die or he will go down in battle and perish.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">The Lord forbid that I should raise my hand against the Lord&#8217;s anointed; but take now the spear that is at his head and the bottle of water, and let us go.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and the bottle of water from Saul&#8217;s head, and they got away. And no man saw or knew or wakened, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain afar off, a great space being between them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">David called to the army and Abner son of Ner, Will you answer, Abner? Abner replied, Who are you, calling [and disturbing] the king?</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">David said to Abner, Are you not a valiant man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in [to your camp] to destroy the king your lord.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">This thing is not good that you have done. As the Lord lives, you deserve to die, because you have not guarded your master, the Lord&#8217;s anointed. And now see where the king&#8217;s spear is and the bottle of water that was at his head.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And Saul knew David&#8217;s voice and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, My voice, my lord O king!</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">And David said, Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? What have I done? Or what evil is in my hand [tonight]?</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is men, may they be cursed before the Lord, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the Lord; for the king of Israel is come out to seek one flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">Then said Saul, I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have [a]played the fool and have erred exceedingly.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">David answered, See the king&#8217;s spear! Let one of the young men come and get it.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">The Lord rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lord&#8217;s anointed.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">And behold, as your life was precious today in my sight, so let my life be precious in the sight of the Lord, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">Then Saul said to David, May you be blessed, my son David; you will both do mightily and surely prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="27"><VERS vnumber="1">27&#160;But David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any more within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">So David arose and went over with the 600 men who were with him to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal&#8217;s widow.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">When it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he sought for him no more.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">And David said to Achish, If I have now found favor in your eyes, let me be given a place to dwell in some country town; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish gave David the town of Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">The time David dwelt in the Philistines&#8217; country was a year and four months.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">Now David and his men went up and made attacks on the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites [enemies of Israel Joshua had failed to exterminate]. For from of old those nations inhabited the land, as one goes to Shur even to the land of Egypt.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and the apparel, and returned to Achish.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">Achish would ask, Against whom have you made a raid today? And David would reply, [a]Against the South  of Judah, or of the Jerahmeelites, or of the Kenites.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">And David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath, thinking, Lest they should say about us, So did David, and so will he do as long as he dwells in the Philistines&#8217; country.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; so he shall be my servant always.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="28"><VERS vnumber="1">28&#160;In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war against Israel. Achish said to David, Understand that you and your men shall go with me to battle.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">David said to Achish, All right, you shall know what your servant can do. Achish said to David, Therefore I will make you my bodyguard always.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the wizards out of the land.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">And the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">When Saul saw the Philistine host, he was afraid; his heart trembled greatly.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">When Saul inquired of the Lord, He refused to answer him, either by dreams or by Urim [a symbol worn by the priest when seeking the will of God for Israel] or by the prophets.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul said to his servants, Find me a woman who is a medium [between the living and the dead], that I may go and inquire of her. His servants said, Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at Endor.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">So Saul disguised himself, put on other raiment, and he and two men with him went and came to the woman at night. He said to her, Perceive for me by the familiar spirit and bring up for me the dead person whom I shall name to you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">The woman said, See here, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and wizards out of the land. Why then do you lay a trap for my life to cause my death?</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord lives, there shall no punishment come to you for this.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">The woman said, Whom shall I bring up for you? He said, Bring up Samuel for me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">And when the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and she said to Saul, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">The king said to her, Be not afraid; what do you see? The woman said to Saul, I see a god [terrifying superhuman being] coming up out of the earth!</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">He said to her, In what form is he? And she said, An old man comes up, covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground and made obeisance.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me to bring me up? Saul answered, I am bitterly distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I should do.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">Samuel said, Why then do you ask me, seeing that the Lord has turned from you and has become your enemy?</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">The Lord has done to you as He said through me He would do; for [He] has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to your neighbor David.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord or execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Moreover, the Lord will also give Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me [among the dead]. The Lord also will give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Then immediately Saul fell full length upon the earth floor [of the medium&#8217;s house], and was exceedingly afraid because of Samuel&#8217;s words. There was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">The woman came to Saul, and seeing that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed you, and I have put my life in my hands and have listened to what you said to me.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">So now, I pray you, listen also to the voice of your handmaid and let me set a morsel of food before you, and eat, so you may have strength when you go on your way.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">But he said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he heeded their words. So he arose from the ground and sat upon the bed.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">The woman had a fat calf in the house; she hurried and killed it, and took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.</VERS><VERS vnumber="25">Then she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night.</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="29"><VERS vnumber="1">29&#160;Now the Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel.</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">As the Philistine lords were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were in the rear with Achish,</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">The Philistine princes said, What are these Hebrews doing here? Achish said to the Philistine princes, Is not this David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days and years, and I have found no fault in him since he deserted to me to this day?</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">And the Philistine princes were angry with Achish and they said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place where you have assigned him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could David reconcile himself to his master? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">Is not this David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish called David and said to him, As surely as the Lord lives, you have been honest and upright, and for you to go out and come in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have found no evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Yet the lords do not approve of you.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">So return now and go peaceably, so as not to displease the Philistine lords.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">And Achish said to David, I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">So now rise up early in the morning, with your master&#8217;s servants who have come with you, and as soon as you are up and have light, depart.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">So David and his men rose up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel [to fight against Israel].</VERS></CHAPTER><CHAPTER cnumber="30"><VERS vnumber="1">30&#160;Now when David and his men came home to Ziklag on the third day, they found that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South  and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag and burned it with fire,</VERS><VERS vnumber="2">And had taken the women and all who were there, both great and small, captive. They killed no one, but carried them off and went on their way.</VERS><VERS vnumber="3">So David and his men came to the town, and behold, it was burned, and their wives and sons and daughters were taken captive.</VERS><VERS vnumber="4">Then David and the men with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep.</VERS><VERS vnumber="5">David&#8217;s two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS><VERS vnumber="6">David was greatly distressed, for the men spoke of stoning him because the souls of them all were bitterly grieved, each man for his sons and daughters. But David encouraged and strengthened himself in the Lord his God.</VERS><VERS vnumber="7">David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech&#8217;s son, I pray you, bring me the ephod. And Abiathar brought him the ephod.</VERS><VERS vnumber="8">And David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them? The Lord answered him, Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.</VERS><VERS vnumber="9">So David went, he and the 600 men with him, and came to the brook Besor; there those remained who were left behind.</VERS><VERS vnumber="10">But David pursued, he and 400 men, for 200 stayed behind who were too exhausted and faint to cross the brook Besor.</VERS><VERS vnumber="11">They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and water to drink,</VERS><VERS vnumber="12">And a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit returned to him, for he had eaten no food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.</VERS><VERS vnumber="13">And David said to him, To whom do you belong? And from where have you come? He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me because three days ago I fell sick.</VERS><VERS vnumber="14">We had made a raid on the South  of the Cherethites and upon that which belongs to Judah and upon the South  of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag with fire.</VERS><VERS vnumber="15">And David said to him, Can you take me down to this band? And he said, Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.</VERS><VERS vnumber="16">And when he had brought David down, behold, the raiders were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.</VERS><VERS vnumber="17">And David smote them from twilight even to the evening of the next day, and not a man of them escaped, except 400 youths who rode camels and fled.</VERS><VERS vnumber="18">David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken and rescued his two wives.</VERS><VERS vnumber="19">Nothing was missing, small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David recovered all.</VERS><VERS vnumber="20">Also David captured all the flocks and herds [which the enemy had], and the people drove those animals before him and said, This is David&#8217;s spoil.</VERS><VERS vnumber="21">And David came to the 200 men who were so exhausted and faint that they could not follow [him] and had been left at the brook Besor [with the baggage]. They came to meet David and those with him, and when he came near to the men, he saluted them.</VERS><VERS vnumber="22">Then all the wicked and base men who went with David said, Because they did not go with us, we will give them nothing of the spoil we have recovered, except that every man may lead away his wife and children and depart.</VERS><VERS vnumber="23">David said, You shall not do so, my brethren, with what the Lord has given us. He has preserved us and has delivered into our hands the troop that came against us.</VERS><VERS vnumber="24">Who would listen to you in this matter? For as is the share of him who goes into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage.
