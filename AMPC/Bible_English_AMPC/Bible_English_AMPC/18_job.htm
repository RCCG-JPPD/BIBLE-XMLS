<h4>1</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> feared God and abstained from <i>and</i> shunned evil <font color='#7a8080'>[because it was wrong]</font>.
<p><sup>2</sup> And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.

<p><sup>3</sup> He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very great body of servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.

<p><sup>4</sup> His sons used to go and feast in the house of each on his day (birthday) in turn, and they invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

<p><sup>5</sup> And when the days of their feasting were over, Job sent for them to purify <i>and</i> hallow them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed <i>or</i> disowned God in their hearts. Thus did Job at all <font color='#7a8080'>[such]</font> times.

<p><sup>6</sup> Now there was a day when the sons (the angels) of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan (the adversary and accuser) also came among them.

<p><sup>7</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, From where did you come? Then Satan answered the Lord, From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it.

<p><sup>8</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fears God and abstains from <i>and</i> shuns evil <font color='#7a8080'>[because it is wrong]</font>?

<p><sup>9</sup> Then Satan answered the Lord, Does Job <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fear God for nothing?

<p><sup>10</sup> Have You not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have conferred prosperity <i>and</i> happiness upon him in the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.

<p><sup>11</sup> But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your face.

<p><sup>12</sup> And the Lord said to Satan (the adversary and the accuser), Behold, all that he has is in your power, only upon the man himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.

<p><sup>13</sup> And there was a day when <font color='#7a8080'>[Job's]</font> sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house <font color='#7a8080'>[on his birthday]</font>,

<p><sup>14</sup> And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,

<p><sup>15</sup> And the Sabeans swooped down upon them and took away <font color='#7a8080'>[the animals]</font>. Indeed, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.

<p><sup>16</sup> While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, The fire of God (lightning) has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.

<p><sup>17</sup> While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, The Chaldeans divided into three bands and made a raid upon the camels and have taken them away, yes, and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.

<p><sup>18</sup> While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,

<p><sup>19</sup> And behold, there came a great <font color='#7a8080'>[whirlwind]</font> from the desert, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you.

<p><sup>20</sup> Then Job arose and rent his robe and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped

<p><sup>21</sup> And said, Naked (without possessions) came I <font color='#7a8080'>[into this world]</font> from my mother's womb, and naked (without possessions) shall I depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed (praised and magnified in worship) be the name of the Lord!

<p><sup>22</sup> In all this Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly.

<h4>2</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Again there was a day when the sons of God <font color='#7a8080'>[the angels]</font> came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan (the adversary and the accuser) came also among them to present himself before the Lord.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, From where do you come? And Satan (the adversary and the accuser) answered the Lord, From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it.

<p><sup>3</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fears God and abstains from <i>and</i> shuns all evil <font color='#7a8080'>[because it is wrong]</font>? And still he holds fast his integrity, although you moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then Satan answered the Lord, Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has will he give for his life.

<p><sup>5</sup> But put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse <i>and</i> renounce You to Your face.

<p><sup>6</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.

<p><sup>7</sup> So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with loathsome <i>and</i> painful sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

<p><sup>8</sup> And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself, and he sat <font color='#7a8080'>[down]</font> among the ashes.

<p><sup>9</sup> Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your blameless uprightness? Renounce God and die!

<p><sup>10</sup> But he said to her, You speak as one of the impious <i>and</i> foolish women would speak. What? Shall we accept <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> good at the hand of God and shall we not accept <font color='#7a8080'>[also]</font> misfortune <i>and</i> what is of a bad nature? In <font color='#7a8080'>[spite of]</font> all this, Job did not sin with his lips.

<p><sup>11</sup> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, for they had made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him.

<p><sup>12</sup> And when they looked from afar off and saw him <font color='#7a8080'>[disfigured]</font> beyond recognition, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe, and they cast dust over their heads toward the heavens.

<p><sup>13</sup> So they sat down with <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief <i>and</i> pain were very great.

<h4>3</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day (birthday).

<p><sup>2</sup> And Job said,

<p><sup>3</sup> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which announced, There is a man-child conceived.

<p><sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness! May not God above regard it, nor light shine upon it.

<p><sup>5</sup> Let gloom and deep darkness claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born).

<p><sup>6</sup> As for that night, let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.

<p><sup>7</sup> Yes, let that night be solitary <i>and</i> barren; let no joyful voice come into it.

<p><sup>8</sup> Let those curse it who curse the day, who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan.

<p><sup>9</sup> Let the stars of the early dawn of that day be dark; let <font color='#7a8080'>[the morning]</font> look in vain for the light, nor let it behold the day's dawning,

<p><sup>10</sup> Because it shut not the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow <i>and</i> trouble from my eyes.

<p><sup>11</sup> Why was I not stillborn? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bore me?

<p><sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?

<p><sup>13</sup> For then would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then would I have been at rest <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font>

<p><sup>14</sup> With kings and counselors of the earth, who built up <font color='#7a8080'>[now]</font> desolate ruins for themselves,

<p><sup>15</sup> Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.

<p><sup>16</sup> Or <font color='#7a8080'>[why]</font> was I not a miscarriage, hidden <i>and</i> put away, as infants who never saw light?

<p><sup>17</sup> There <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font> the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.

<p><sup>18</sup> There the <font color='#7a8080'>[captive]</font> prisoners rest together; they hear not the taskmaster's voice.

<p><sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master.

<p><sup>20</sup> Why is light <font color='#7a8080'>[of life]</font> given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,

<p><sup>21</sup> Who long <i>and</i> wait for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,

<p><sup>22</sup> Who rejoice exceedingly and are elated when they find the grave?

<p><sup>23</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Why is the light of day given]</font> to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in?

<p><sup>24</sup> For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings are poured out like water.

<p><sup>25</sup> For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me, and that of which I am afraid befalls me.

<p><sup>26</sup> I was not <i>or</i> am not at ease, nor had I <i>or</i> have I rest, nor was I <i>or</i> am I quiet, yet trouble came <i>and</i> still comes <font color='#7a8080'>[upon me]</font>.

<h4>4</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> If we venture to converse with you, will you be offended? Yet who can restrain himself from speaking?

<p><sup>3</sup> Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.

<p><sup>4</sup> Your words have held firm him who was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.

<p><sup>5</sup> But now it is come upon you, and you faint <i>and</i> are grieved; it touches you, and you are troubled <i>and</i> dismayed.

<p><sup>6</sup> Is not your <font color='#7a8080'>[reverent]</font> fear of God your confidence and the integrity <i>and</i> uprightness of your ways your hope?

<p><sup>7</sup> Think <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font>, I beg of you: who, being innocent, ever perished? Or where were those upright <i>and</i> in right standing with God cut off?

<p><sup>8</sup> As I myself have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble <i>and</i> mischief reap the same.

<p><sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.

<p><sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken.

<p><sup>11</sup> The old <i>and</i> strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.

<p><sup>12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a whisper of it.

<p><sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,

<p><sup>14</sup> Fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones shake.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up!

<p><sup>16</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The spirit]</font> stood still, but I could not discern the appearance of it. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, and then I heard a voice, saying,

<p><sup>17</sup> Can mortal man be just before God, <i>or</i> be more right than He is? Can a man be pure before his Maker, <i>or</i> be more cleansed than He is?

<p><sup>18</sup> Even in His <font color='#7a8080'>[heavenly]</font> servants He puts no trust <i>or</i> confidence, and His angels He charges with folly <i>and</i> error—

<p><sup>19</sup> How much more those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed like the moth.

<p><sup>20</sup> Between morning and evening they are destroyed; without anyone noticing it they perish forever.

<p><sup>21</sup> Is not their tent cord plucked up within them <font color='#7a8080'>[so that the tent falls]</font>? Do they not die, and that without <font color='#7a8080'>[acquiring]</font> wisdom?

<h4>5</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Call now—is there any who will answer you? And to which of the holy <font color='#7a8080'>[angels]</font> will you turn?

<p><sup>2</sup> For vexation <i>and</i> rage kill the foolish man; jealousy <i>and</i> indignation slay the simple.

<p><sup>3</sup> I have seen the foolish taking root <font color='#7a8080'>[and outwardly prospering]</font>, but suddenly I saw that his dwelling was cursed <font color='#7a8080'>[for his doom was certain]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> His children are far from safety; <font color='#7a8080'>[involved in their father's ruin]</font> they are crushed in the <font color='#7a8080'>[court of justice in the city's]</font> gate, and there is no one to deliver them.

<p><sup>5</sup> His harvest the hungry eat and take it even <font color='#7a8080'>[when it grows]</font> among the thorns; the snare opens for <font color='#7a8080'>[his]</font> wealth.

<p><sup>6</sup> For affliction comes not forth from the dust, neither does trouble spring forth out of the ground.

<p><sup>7</sup> But man is born to trouble as the sparks <i>and</i> the flames fly upward.

<p><sup>8</sup> As for me, I would seek God <i>and</i> inquire of <i>and</i> require Him, and to God would I commit my cause—

<p><sup>9</sup> Who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number,

<p><sup>10</sup> Who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters upon the fields,

<p><sup>11</sup> So that He sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn He lifts to safety.

<p><sup>12</sup> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise <i>or</i> anything of <font color='#7a8080'>[lasting]</font> worth.

<p><sup>13</sup> He catches the <font color='#7a8080'>[so-called]</font> wise in their own trickiness, and the counsel of the schemers is brought to a quick end.

<p><sup>14</sup> In the daytime they meet in darkness, and at noon they grope as in the night.

<p><sup>15</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> saves <font color='#7a8080'>[the fatherless]</font> from the sword of their mouth, and the needy from the hand of the mighty.

<p><sup>16</sup> So the poor have hope, and iniquity shuts her mouth.

<p><sup>17</sup> Happy <i>and</i> fortunate is the man whom God reproves; so do not despise <i>or</i> reject the correction of the Almighty <font color='#7a8080'>[subjecting you to trial and suffering]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> For He wounds, but He binds up; He smites, but His hands heal.

<p><sup>19</sup> He will rescue you in six troubles; in seven nothing that is evil <font color='#7a8080'>[for you]</font> will touch you.

<p><sup>20</sup> In famine He will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.

<p><sup>21</sup> You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.

<p><sup>22</sup> At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the living creatures of the earth.

<p><sup>23</sup> For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.

<p><sup>24</sup> And you shall know that your tent shall be in peace, and you shall visit your fold <i>and</i> your dwelling and miss nothing <font color='#7a8080'>[from them]</font>.

<p><sup>25</sup> You shall know also that your children shall be many, and your offspring as the grass of the earth.

<p><sup>26</sup> You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, and as a shock of grain goes up <font color='#7a8080'>[to the threshing floor]</font> in its season.

<p><sup>27</sup> This is what we have searched out; it is true. Hear <i>and</i> heed it and know for yourself <font color='#7a8080'>[for your good]</font>.

<h4>6</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> Oh, that my impatience <i>and</i> vexation might be <font color='#7a8080'>[thoroughly]</font> weighed and all my calamity be laid up over against them in the balances, one against the other <font color='#7a8080'>[to see if my grief is unmanly]</font>!

<p><sup>3</sup> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash <i>and</i> wild,

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But it is]</font> because the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison which my spirit drinks up; the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.

<p><sup>5</sup> Does the wild ass bray when it has grass? Or does the ox low over its fodder?

<p><sup>6</sup> Can that which has no taste to it be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[These afflictions]</font> my soul refuses to touch! Such things are like diseased food to me <font color='#7a8080'>[sickening and repugnant]</font>!

<p><sup>8</sup> Oh, that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!

<p><sup>9</sup> I even wish that it would please God to crush me, that He would let loose His hand and cut me off!

<p><sup>10</sup> Then would I still have consolation—yes, I would leap <font color='#7a8080'>[for joy]</font> amid unsparing pain <font color='#7a8080'>[though I shrink from it]</font>—that I have not concealed <i>or</i> denied the words of the Holy One!

<p><sup>11</sup> What strength have I left, that I should wait <i>and</i> hope? And what is ahead of me, that I should be patient?

<p><sup>12</sup> Is my strength <i>and</i> endurance that of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?

<p><sup>13</sup> Is it not that I have no help in myself, and that wisdom is quite driven from me?

<p><sup>14</sup> To him who is about to faint <i>and</i> despair, kindness is due from his friend, lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty.

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[You]</font> my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away,

<p><sup>16</sup> Which are black <i>and</i> turbid by reason of the ice, <i>and</i> in which the snows hides itself;

<p><sup>17</sup> When they get warm, they shrink <i>and</i> disappear; when it is hot, they vanish out of their place.

<p><sup>18</sup> The caravans which travel by way of them turn aside; they go into the waste places and perish. <font color='#7a8080'>[Such is my disappointment in you, the friends I fully trusted.]</font>

<p><sup>19</sup> The caravans of Tema looked <font color='#7a8080'>[for water]</font>, the companies of Sheba waited for them <font color='#7a8080'>[in vain]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> They were confounded because they had hoped <font color='#7a8080'>[to find water]</font>; they came there and were bitterly disappointed.

<p><sup>21</sup> Now to me you are <font color='#7a8080'>[like a dried-up brook]</font>; you see my dismay <i>and</i> terror, and <font color='#7a8080'>[believing me to be a victim of God's anger]</font> you are afraid <font color='#7a8080'>[to sympathize with me]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> Did I ever say, Bring me a gift, or Pay a bribe on my account from your wealth

<p><sup>23</sup> To deliver me from the adversary's hand, or Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?

<p><sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I will hold my peace; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

<p><sup>25</sup> How forcible are words of straightforward speech! But what does your arguing argue <i>and</i> prove <i>or</i> your reproof reprove?

<p><sup>26</sup> Do you imagine your words to be an argument, but the speeches of one who is desperate to be as wind?

<p><sup>27</sup> Yes, you would cast lots over the fatherless and bargain away your friend.

<p><sup>28</sup> Now be pleased to look upon me, that it may be evident to you if I lie <font color='#7a8080'>[for surely I would not lie to your face]</font>.

<p><sup>29</sup> Return <font color='#7a8080'>[from your suspicion]</font>, I pray you, let there be no injustice; yes, return again <font color='#7a8080'>[to confidence in me]</font>, my vindication is in it.

<p><sup>30</sup> Is there wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern what is destructive?

<h4>7</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Is there not an <font color='#7a8080'>[appointed]</font> warfare <i>and</i> hard labor to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?

<p><sup>2</sup> As a servant earnestly longs for the shade <i>and</i> the evening shadows, and as a hireling who looks for the reward of his work,

<p><sup>3</sup> So am I allotted months of futile <font color='#7a8080'>[suffering]</font>, and <font color='#7a8080'>[long]</font> nights of misery are appointed to me.

<p><sup>4</sup> When I lie down I say, When shall I arise and the night be gone? And I am full of tossing to and fro till the dawning of the day.

<p><sup>5</sup> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and has become loathsome, <i>and</i> it closes up and breaks out afresh.

<p><sup>6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.

<p><sup>7</sup> Oh, remember that my life is but wind (a puff, a breath, a sob); my eye shall see good no more.

<p><sup>8</sup> The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I shall be gone.

<p><sup>9</sup> As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol (the place of the dead) shall come up no more.

<p><sup>10</sup> He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.

<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font>!

<p><sup>12</sup> Am I the sea, or the sea monster, that You set a watch over me?

<p><sup>13</sup> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint,

<p><sup>14</sup> Then You scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions,

<p><sup>15</sup> So that I would choose strangling <i>and</i> death rather than these my bones.

<p><sup>16</sup> I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are a breath (futility).

<p><sup>17</sup> What is man that You should magnify him <i>and</i> think him important? And that You should set Your mind upon him?

<p><sup>18</sup> And that You should visit him every morning and try him every moment?

<p><sup>19</sup> How long will Your <font color='#7a8080'>[plaguing]</font> glance not look away from me, nor You let me alone till I swallow my spittle?

<p><sup>20</sup> If I have sinned, what <font color='#7a8080'>[harm]</font> have I done You, O You Watcher <i>and</i> Keeper of men? Why have You set me as a mark for You, so that I am a burden to myself <font color='#7a8080'>[and You]</font>?

<p><sup>21</sup> And why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; and <font color='#7a8080'>[even if]</font> You will seek me diligently, <font color='#7a8080'>[it will be too late, for]</font> I shall not be.

<h4>8</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite,

<p><sup>2</sup> How long will you say these things <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font>? And how long shall the words of your mouth be as a mighty wind?

<p><sup>3</sup> Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

<p><sup>4</sup> If your children have sinned against Him, then He has delivered them into the power of their transgression.

<p><sup>5</sup> If you will seek God diligently and make your supplication to the Almighty,

<p><sup>6</sup> Then, if you are pure and upright, surely He will bestir Himself for you and make your righteous dwelling prosperous again.

<p><sup>7</sup> And though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase.

<p><sup>8</sup> For inquire, I pray you, of the former age and apply yourself to that which their fathers have searched out,

<p><sup>9</sup> For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow.

<p><sup>10</sup> Shall not <font color='#7a8080'>[the forefathers]</font> teach you and tell you and utter words out of their hearts (the deepest part of their nature)?

<p><sup>11</sup> Can the rush <i>or</i> papyrus grow up without marsh? Can the flag <i>or</i> reed grass grow without water?

<p><sup>12</sup> While it is yet green, in flower, and not cut down, it withers before any other herb <font color='#7a8080'>[when without water]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> So are the ways of all who forget God; and the hope of the godless shall perish.

<p><sup>14</sup> For his confidence breaks, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the object of]</font> his trust is a spider's web.

<p><sup>15</sup> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold fast to it, but it shall not last.

<p><sup>16</sup> He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden.

<p><sup>17</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Godless]</font> his roots are wrapped about the <font color='#7a8080'>[stone]</font> heap, and see their way <font color='#7a8080'>[promisingly]</font> among the rocks.

<p><sup>18</sup> But if <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> snatches him from his property, <font color='#7a8080'>[then having passed into the hands of others]</font> it <font color='#7a8080'>[his property]</font> will forget <i>and</i> deny him, <font color='#7a8080'>[saying,]</font> I have never seen you <font color='#7a8080'>[before, as if ashamed of him—like his former friends]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> See, this is the joy of going the way <font color='#7a8080'>[of the ungodly]</font>! And from the dust others will spring up <font color='#7a8080'>[to take his place]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> Behold, as surely as God will never uphold wrongdoers, He will never cast away a blameless man.

<p><sup>21</sup> He will yet fill your mouth with laughter <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> and your lips with joyful shouting.

<p><sup>22</sup> Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tents of the wicked shall be no more.

<h4>9</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> Yes, I know it is true. But how can mortal man be right before God?

<p><sup>3</sup> If one should want to contend with Him, he cannot answer one <font color='#7a8080'>[of His questions]</font> in a thousand.

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> hardened himself against Him and prospered <i>or</i> even been safe?

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> Who removes the mountains, and they know it not when He overturns them in His anger;

<p><sup>6</sup> Who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars of it tremble;

<p><sup>7</sup> Who commands the sun, and it rises not; Who seals up the stars <font color='#7a8080'>[from view]</font>;

<p><sup>8</sup> Who alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the waves <i>and</i> high places of the sea;

<p><sup>9</sup> Who made <font color='#7a8080'>[the constellations]</font> the Bear, Orion, and the <font color='#7a8080'>[loose cluster]</font> Pleiades, and the <font color='#7a8080'>[vast starry]</font> spaces of the south;

<p><sup>10</sup> Who does great things past finding out, yes, marvelous things without number.

<p><sup>11</sup> Behold, He goes by me, and I see Him not; He passes on also, but I perceive Him not.

<p><sup>12</sup> Behold, He snatches away; who can hinder <i>or</i> turn Him back? Who will say to Him, What are You doing?

<p><sup>13</sup> God will not withdraw His anger; the <font color='#7a8080'>[proud]</font> helpers of Rahab <font color='#7a8080'>[arrogant monster of the sea]</font> bow under Him.

<p><sup>14</sup> How much less shall I answer Him, choosing out my words to reason with Him

<p><sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous (upright and innocent) yet I could not answer? I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent <i>and</i> Judge <font color='#7a8080'>[for my right]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> If I called and He answered me, yet would I not believe that He listened to my voice.

<p><sup>17</sup> For He overwhelms <i>and</i> breaks me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause.

<p><sup>18</sup> He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.

<p><sup>19</sup> If I speak of strength, behold, He is mighty! And if of justice, Who, says He, will summon Me?

<p><sup>20</sup> Though I am innocent <i>and</i> in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, He would prove me perverse.

<p><sup>21</sup> Though I am blameless, I regard not myself; I despise my life.

<p><sup>22</sup> It is all one; therefore I say, God <font color='#7a8080'>[does not discriminate, but]</font> destroys the blameless and the wicked.

<p><sup>23</sup> When <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the calamity <i>and</i> trial of the innocent.

<p><sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges <font color='#7a8080'>[so that they are blinded to justice]</font>. If it is not <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font>, who then is it <font color='#7a8080'>[responsible for all this inequality]</font>?

<p><sup>25</sup> Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.

<p><sup>26</sup> They are passed away like the swift rowboats made of reeds, or like the eagle that swoops down on the prey.

<p><sup>27</sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer <i>and</i> brighten up,

<p><sup>28</sup> I become afraid of all my pains <i>and</i> sorrows <font color='#7a8080'>[yet to come]</font>, for I know You will not pronounce me innocent <font color='#7a8080'>[by removing them]</font>.

<p><sup>29</sup> I shall be held guilty <i>and</i> be condemned; why then should I labor in vain <font color='#7a8080'>[to appear innocent]</font>?

<p><sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,

<p><sup>31</sup> Yet You will plunge me into the ditch, and my own clothes will abhor me <font color='#7a8080'>[and refuse to cover so foul a body]</font>.

<p><sup>32</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> is not a <font color='#7a8080'>[mere]</font> man, as I am, that I should answer Him, that we should come together in court.

<p><sup>33</sup> There is no umpire between us, who might lay his hand upon us both, <font color='#7a8080'>[would that there were!]</font>

<p><sup>34</sup> That He might take His rod away from <font color='#7a8080'>[threatening]</font> me, and that the fear of Him might not terrify me.

<p><sup>35</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Then]</font> would I speak and not fear Him, but I am not so in myself <font color='#7a8080'>[to make me afraid, were only a fair trial given me]</font>.

<h4>10</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> I am weary of my life <i>and</i> loathe it! I will give free expression to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

<p><sup>2</sup> I will say to God, Do not condemn me <font color='#7a8080'>[do not make me guilty]</font>! Show me why You contend with me.

<p><sup>3</sup> Does it seem good to You that You should oppress, that You should despise <i>and</i> reject the work of Your hands, and favor the schemes of the wicked?

<p><sup>4</sup> Have You eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?

<p><sup>5</sup> Are Your days as the days of man, are Your years as man's <font color='#7a8080'>[years]</font>,

<p><sup>6</sup> That You inquire after my iniquity and search for my sin—

<p><sup>7</sup> Although You know that I am not wicked <i>or</i> guilty and that there is none who can deliver me out of Your hand?

<p><sup>8</sup> Your hands have formed me and made me. Would You turn around and destroy me?

<p><sup>9</sup> Remember <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font>, I beseech You, that You have fashioned me as clay <font color='#7a8080'>[out of the same earth material, exquisitely and elaborately]</font>. And will You bring me into dust again?

<p><sup>10</sup> Have You not poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese?

<p><sup>11</sup> You have clothed me with skin and flesh and have knit me together with bones and sinews.

<p><sup>12</sup> You have granted me life and favor, and Your providence has preserved my spirit.

<p><sup>13</sup> Yet these <font color='#7a8080'>[the present evils]</font> have You hid in Your heart <font color='#7a8080'>[for me since my creation]</font>; I know that this was with You <font color='#7a8080'>[in Your purpose and thought]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> If I sin, then You observe me, and You will not acquit me from my iniquity <i>and</i> guilt.

<p><sup>15</sup> If I am wicked, woe unto me! And if I am righteous, yet must I not lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and the sight of my affliction.

<p><sup>16</sup> If I lift myself up, You hunt me like a lion and again show Yourself <font color='#7a8080'>[inflicting]</font> marvelous <font color='#7a8080'>[trials]</font> upon me.

<p><sup>17</sup> You renew Your witnesses against me and increase Your indignation toward me; I am as if attacked by a troop time after time.

<p><sup>18</sup> Why then did You bring me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me!

<p><sup>19</sup> I should have been as though I had not existed; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

<p><sup>20</sup> Are not my days few? Cease then and let me alone, that I may take a little comfort <i>and</i> cheer up

<p><sup>21</sup> Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death,

<p><sup>22</sup> The land of sunless gloom as intense darkness, <font color='#7a8080'>[the land]</font> of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as thick darkness.

<h4>11</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite replied,

<p><sup>2</sup> Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk <font color='#7a8080'>[and making such great professions]</font> be pronounced free from guilt <i>or</i> blame?

<p><sup>3</sup> Should your boastings <i>and</i> babble make men keep silent? And when you mock <i>and</i> scoff, shall no man make you ashamed?

<p><sup>4</sup> For you have said, My doctrine <font color='#7a8080'>[that God afflicts the righteous knowingly]</font> is pure, and I am clean in <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> eyes.

<p><sup>5</sup> But oh, that God would speak, and open His lips against you,

<p><sup>6</sup> And that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For He is manifold in understanding! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your guilt <i>and</i> iniquity <font color='#7a8080'>[deserve]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> Can you find out the deep things of God, or can you by searching find out the limits of the Almighty <font color='#7a8080'>[explore His depths, ascend to His heights, extend to His breadths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]</font>?

<p><sup>8</sup> His wisdom is as high as the heights of heaven! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the place of the dead)! What can you know?

<p><sup>9</sup> Longer in measure <font color='#7a8080'>[and scope]</font> is it than the earth, and broader than the sea.

<p><sup>10</sup> If <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> sweeps in and arrests and calls into judgment, who can hinder Him? <font color='#7a8080'>[If He is against a man, who shall call Him to account for it?]</font>

<p><sup>11</sup> For He recognizes <i>and</i> knows hollow, wicked, <i>and</i> useless men (men of falsehood); when He sees iniquity, will He not consider it?

<p><sup>12</sup> But a stupid man will get wisdom <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> when a wild donkey's colt is born a man <font color='#7a8080'>[as when he thinks himself free because he is lifted up in pride]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> If you set your heart aright and stretch out your hands to <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font>,

<p><sup>14</sup> If you put sin out of your hand <i>and</i> far away from you and let not evil dwell in your tents;

<p><sup>15</sup> Then can you lift up your face to Him without stain <font color='#7a8080'>[of sin, and unashamed]</font>; yes, you shall be steadfast <i>and</i> secure; you shall not fear.

<p><sup>16</sup> For you shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away.

<p><sup>17</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[your]</font> life shall be clearer than the noonday <i>and</i> rise above it; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.

<p><sup>18</sup> And you shall be secure <i>and</i> feel confident because there is hope; yes, you shall search about you, and you shall take your rest in safety.

<p><sup>19</sup> You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall sue for your favor.

<p><sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked shall look <font color='#7a8080'>[for relief]</font> in vain, and they shall not escape <font color='#7a8080'>[the justice of God]</font>; and their hope shall be to give up the ghost.

<h4>12</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> No doubt you are the <font color='#7a8080'>[only wise]</font> people <font color='#7a8080'>[in the world]</font>, and wisdom will die with you!

<p><sup>3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's wisdom and might]</font>?

<p><sup>4</sup> I am become one who is a laughingstock to his friend; I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him—a just, upright (blameless) man—laughed to scorn!

<p><sup>5</sup> In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune—but it is ready for those whose feet slip.

<p><sup>6</sup> The dwellings of robbers prosper; those who provoke God are <font color='#7a8080'>[apparently]</font> secure; God supplies them abundantly <font color='#7a8080'>[who have no god but their own hands and power]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> For ask now the animals, and they will teach you <font color='#7a8080'>[that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character]</font>; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you;

<p><sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[with its other forms of life]</font>, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare <font color='#7a8080'>[this truth]</font> to you.

<p><sup>9</sup> Who <font color='#7a8080'>[is so blind as]</font> not to recognize in all these <font color='#7a8080'>[that good and evil are promiscuously scattered throughout nature and human life]</font> that it is God's hand which does it <font color='#7a8080'>[and God's way]</font>?

<p><sup>10</sup> In His hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind.

<p><sup>11</sup> Is it not the task of the ear to discriminate between <font color='#7a8080'>[wise and unwise]</font> words, just as the mouth distinguishes <font color='#7a8080'>[between desirable and undesirable]</font> food?

<p><sup>12</sup> With the aged <font color='#7a8080'>[you say]</font> is wisdom, and with length of days comes understanding.

<p><sup>13</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> with <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> are <font color='#7a8080'>[perfect]</font> wisdom and might; He <font color='#7a8080'>[alone]</font> has <font color='#7a8080'>[true]</font> counsel and understanding.

<p><sup>14</sup> Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be built again; He shuts a man in, and none can open.

<p><sup>15</sup> He withholds the waters, and the land dries up; again, He sends forth <font color='#7a8080'>[rains]</font>, and they overwhelm the land <i>or</i> transform it.

<p><sup>16</sup> With Him are might and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His <font color='#7a8080'>[and in His power]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> He leads <font color='#7a8080'>[great and scheming]</font> counselors away stripped <i>and</i> barefoot and makes the judges fools <font color='#7a8080'>[in human estimation, by overthrowing their plans]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> He looses the fetters <font color='#7a8080'>[ordered]</font> by kings and has <font color='#7a8080'>[the]</font> waistcloth <font color='#7a8080'>[of a slave]</font> bound about their <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> loins.

<p><sup>19</sup> He leads away priests as spoil, and men firmly seated He overturns.

<p><sup>20</sup> He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment <i>and</i> discretion of the aged.

<p><sup>21</sup> He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong <font color='#7a8080'>[disabling them, bringing low the pride of the learned]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> He uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings into light black gloom <i>and</i> the shadow of death.

<p><sup>23</sup> He makes nations great, and He destroys them; He enlarges nations <font color='#7a8080'>[and then straitens and shrinks them again]</font>, and leads them <font color='#7a8080'>[away captive]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> He takes away understanding from the leaders of the people of the land <i>and</i> of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no path.

<p><sup>25</sup> They grope in the dark without light, and He makes them to stagger <i>and</i> wander like a drunken man.

<h4>13</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Job continued:]</font> Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.

<p><sup>2</sup> What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.

<p><sup>3</sup> Surely I wish to speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue <i>and</i> reason my case with God <font color='#7a8080'>[that He may explain the conflict between what I believe of Him and what I see of Him]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> But you are forgers of lies <font color='#7a8080'>[you defame my character most untruthfully]</font>; you are all physicians of no value <i>and</i> have no remedy to offer.

<p><sup>5</sup> Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace! Then you would evidence your wisdom <i>and</i> you might pass for wise men.

<p><sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.

<p><sup>7</sup> Will you speak unrighteously for God and talk deceitfully for Him?

<p><sup>8</sup> Will you show partiality to Him <font color='#7a8080'>[be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]</font>? Will you act as special pleaders for God?

<p><sup>9</sup> Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics <font color='#7a8080'>[with me]</font>? Or as one deceives <i>and</i> mocks a man, do you deceive <i>and</i> mock Him?

<p><sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality.

<p><sup>11</sup> Shall not His majesty make you afraid, and should not your awe for Him restrain you?

<p><sup>12</sup> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes <font color='#7a8080'>[valueless]</font>; your defenses are defenses of clay <font color='#7a8080'>[and will crumble]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Hold your peace! Let me alone, so I may speak; and let come on me what may.

<p><sup>14</sup> Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hands <font color='#7a8080'>[incurring the danger of God's wrath]</font>?

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[I do it because, though He slay me, yet will I wait for and trust Him and]</font> behold, He will slay me; I have no hope—nevertheless, I will maintain <i>and</i> argue my ways before Him <i>and</i> even to His face.

<p><sup>16</sup> This will be my salvation, that a polluted <i>and</i> godless man shall not come before Him.

<p><sup>17</sup> Listen diligently to my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears.

<p><sup>18</sup> Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified <i>and</i> vindicated.

<p><sup>19</sup> Who is he who will argue against <i>and</i> refute me? For then I would hold my peace and expire.

<p><sup>20</sup> Only <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> grant two conditions to me, and then will I not hide myself from You:

<p><sup>21</sup> Withdraw Your hand and take this bodily suffering far from me; and let not my <font color='#7a8080'>[reverent]</font> dread of You terrify me.

<p><sup>22</sup> Then <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord]</font> call and I will answer, or let me speak, and You answer me.

<p><sup>23</sup> How many are my iniquities and sins <font color='#7a8080'>[that so much sorrow should come to me]</font>? Make me recognize <i>and</i> know my transgression and my sin.

<p><sup>24</sup> Why do You hide Your face <font color='#7a8080'>[as if offended]</font> and alienate me as if I were Your enemy?

<p><sup>25</sup> Will You harass <i>and</i> frighten a <font color='#7a8080'>[poor, helpless]</font> leaf driven to and fro, and will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble?

<p><sup>26</sup> For You write bitter things against me <font color='#7a8080'>[in Your bill of indictment]</font> and make me inherit <i>and</i> be accountable now for the iniquities of my youth.

<p><sup>27</sup> You put my feet also in the stocks and observe critically all my paths; You set a circle <i>and</i> limit around the soles of my feet <font color='#7a8080'>[which I must not overstep]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> And he wastes away as a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.

<h4>14</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Man who is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.

<p><sup>2</sup> He comes forth like a flower and withers; he flees also like a shadow and continues not.

<p><sup>3</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord]</font> do You open Your eyes upon such a one, and bring me into judgment with You?

<p><sup>4</sup> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!

<p><sup>5</sup> Since a man's days are already determined, and the number of his months is wholly in Your control, and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time—

<p><sup>6</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[O God]</font> turn from him <font color='#7a8080'>[and cease to watch him so pitilessly]</font>; let him rest until he has accomplished as does a hireling the appointed time for his day.

<p><sup>7</sup> For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and that the tender shoots of it will not cease. <font color='#7a8080'>[But there is no such hope for man.]</font>

<p><sup>8</sup> Though its roots grow old in the earth and its stock dies in the ground,

<p><sup>9</sup> Yet through the scent <font color='#7a8080'>[and breathing]</font> of water <font color='#7a8080'>[the stump of the tree]</font> will bud and bring forth boughs like a young plant.

<p><sup>10</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[the brave, strong]</font> man must die and lie prostrate; yes, man breathes his last, and where is he?

<p><sup>11</sup> As waters evaporate from the lake, and the river drains and dries up,

<p><sup>12</sup> So man lies down and does not rise <font color='#7a8080'>[to his former state]</font>. Till the heavens are no more, men will not awake nor be raised <font color='#7a8080'>[physically]</font> out of their sleep.

<p><sup>13</sup> Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the unseen state), that You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, that You would set a definite time and then remember me earnestly <font color='#7a8080'>[and imprint me on your heart]</font>!

<p><sup>14</sup> If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare <i>and</i> service I will wait, till my change <i>and</i> release shall come.

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Then]</font> You would call and I would answer You; You would yearn for <font color='#7a8080'>[me]</font> the work of Your hands.

<p><sup>16</sup> But now You number each of my steps and take note of my every sin.

<p><sup>17</sup> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You glue up my iniquity <font color='#7a8080'>[to preserve it in full for the day of reckoning]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles to nothing, and as the rock is removed out of its place,

<p><sup>19</sup> As waters wear away the stones and as floods wash away the soil of the earth, so You <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> destroy the hope of man.

<p><sup>20</sup> You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his appearance <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font> and send him away <font color='#7a8080'>[from the presence of the living]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; they are brought low, and he perceives it not.

<p><sup>22</sup> But his body <font color='#7a8080'>[lamenting its decay in the grave]</font> shall grieve over him, and his soul shall mourn <font color='#7a8080'>[over the body of clay which it once enlivened]</font>.

<h4>15</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font>,

<p><sup>2</sup> Should a wise man utter such windy knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[as we have just heard]</font> and fill himself with the east wind <font color='#7a8080'>[of withering, parching, and violent accusations]</font>?

<p><sup>3</sup> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? Or with speeches with which he can do no good?

<p><sup>4</sup> Indeed, you are doing away with <font color='#7a8080'>[reverential]</font> fear, and you are hindering <i>and</i> diminishing meditation <i>and</i> devotion before God.

<p><sup>5</sup> For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.

<p><sup>6</sup> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; yes, your own lips testify against you.

<p><sup>7</sup> Are you the first man that was born <font color='#7a8080'>[the original wise man]</font>? Or were you created before the hills?

<p><sup>8</sup> Were you present to hear the secret counsel of God? And do you limit <font color='#7a8080'>[the possession of]</font> wisdom to yourself?

<p><sup>9</sup> What do you know that we know not? What do you understand that is not equally clear to us?

<p><sup>10</sup> Among us are both the gray-haired and the aged, older than your father by far.

<p><sup>11</sup> Are God's consolations <font color='#7a8080'>[as we have interpreted them to you]</font> too trivial for you? Is there any secret thing (any bosom sin) which you have not given up? <font color='#7a8080'>[Or]</font> were we too gentle <font color='#7a8080'>[in our first speech]</font> toward you to be effective?

<p><sup>12</sup> Why does your heart carry you away <font color='#7a8080'>[why allow yourself to be controlled by feeling]</font>? And why do your eyes flash <font color='#7a8080'>[in anger or contempt]</font>,

<p><sup>13</sup> That you turn your spirit against God and let <font color='#7a8080'>[such]</font> words <font color='#7a8080'>[as you have spoken]</font> go out of your mouth?

<p><sup>14</sup> What is man, that he could be pure <i>and</i> clean? And he who is born of a woman, that he could be right <i>and</i> just?

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> puts no trust in His holy ones <font color='#7a8080'>[the angels]</font>; indeed, the heavens are not clean in His sight—

<p><sup>16</sup> How much less that which is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water?

<p><sup>17</sup> I will show you, hear me; and that which I have seen I will relate,

<p><sup>18</sup> What wise men have not hid but have freely communicated; it was told to them by their fathers,

<p><sup>19</sup> Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger intruded <i>or</i> passed among them <font color='#7a8080'>[corrupting the truth]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> The wicked man suffers with <font color='#7a8080'>[self-inflicted]</font> torment all his days, through all the years that are numbered <i>and</i> laid up for him, the oppressor.

<p><sup>21</sup> A <font color='#7a8080'>[dreadful]</font> sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him <font color='#7a8080'>[the dwellings of robbers are not at peace]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> He believes that he will not return out of darkness, and <font color='#7a8080'>[because of his guilt]</font> he is waited for by the sword <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's vengeance]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> He wanders abroad for food, saying, Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness <i>and</i> destruction is already close upon him.

<p><sup>24</sup> Distress and anguish terrify him; <font color='#7a8080'>[he knows]</font> they shall prevail against him, like a king ready for battle.

<p><sup>25</sup> Because he has stretched out his hand against God and bids defiance <i>and</i> behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,

<p><sup>26</sup> Running stubbornly against Him with a thickly ornamented shield;

<p><sup>27</sup> Because he has covered his face with his fat, adding layers of fat on his loins <font color='#7a8080'>[giving himself up to animal pleasures]</font>,

<p><sup>28</sup> And has lived in desolate <font color='#7a8080'>[God-forsaken]</font> cities and in houses which no man should inhabit, which were destined to become heaps <font color='#7a8080'>[of ruins]</font>;

<p><sup>29</sup> He shall not be rich, neither shall his wealth last, neither shall his produce bend to the earth <i>nor</i> his possessions be extended on the earth.

<p><sup>30</sup> He shall not depart out of darkness <font color='#7a8080'>[and escape from calamity; the wrath of God]</font> shall consume him as flame consumes a dry tree, and by the blast of His mouth he shall be swept away.

<p><sup>31</sup> Let him not deceive himself and trust in vanity (emptiness, falseness, and futility), for these shall be his recompense <font color='#7a8080'>[for such living]</font>.

<p><sup>32</sup> It shall be accomplished <i>and</i> paid in full while he still lives, and his branch shall not be green <font color='#7a8080'>[but shall wither away]</font>.

<p><sup>33</sup> He shall fail to bring his grapes to maturity <font color='#7a8080'>[leaving them to wither unnourished]</font> on the vine and shall cast off blossoms <font color='#7a8080'>[and fail to bring forth fruit]</font> like the olive tree.

<p><sup>34</sup> For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery (wrong and injustice).

<p><sup>35</sup> They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, and their inmost soul hatches deceit.

<h4>16</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> I have heard many such things; wearisome <i>and</i> miserable comforters are you all!

<p><sup>3</sup> Will your futile words of wind have no end? Or what makes you so bold to answer <font color='#7a8080'>[me like this]</font>?

<p><sup>4</sup> I also could speak as you do, if you were in my stead; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you.

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But]</font> I would strengthen <i>and</i> encourage you with <font color='#7a8080'>[the words of]</font> my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would soothe your suffering.

<p><sup>6</sup> If I speak <font color='#7a8080'>[to you miserable comforters]</font>, my sorrow is not soothed <i>or</i> lessened; and if I refrain <font color='#7a8080'>[from speaking]</font>, in what way am I eased? <font color='#7a8080'>[I hardly know whether to answer you or be silent.]</font>

<p><sup>7</sup> But now <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> has taken away my strength. You <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> have made desolate all my family <i>and</i> associates.

<p><sup>8</sup> You have laid firm hold on me <i>and</i> have shriveled me up, which is a witness against me; and my leanness <font color='#7a8080'>[and wretched state of body]</font> are further evidence <font color='#7a8080'>[against me]</font>; <font color='#7a8080'>[they]</font> testify to my face.

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[My adversary Satan]</font> has torn <font color='#7a8080'>[me]</font> in his wrath and hated <i>and</i> persecuted me; he has gnashed upon me with his teeth; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.

<p><sup>10</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The forces of evil]</font> have gaped at me with their mouths; they have struck me upon the cheek insolently; they massed themselves together <i>and</i> conspired unanimously against me.

<p><sup>11</sup> God has delivered me to the ungodly (to the evil one) and cast me <font color='#7a8080'>[headlong]</font> into the hands of the wicked (Satan's host).

<p><sup>12</sup> I was living at ease, but <font color='#7a8080'>[Satan]</font> crushed me <i>and</i> broke me apart; yes, he seized me by the neck and dashed me in pieces; then he set me up for his target.

<p><sup>13</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Satan's]</font> arrows whiz around me. He slashes open my vitals and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Satan]</font> stabs me, making breach after breach <i>and</i> attacking again and again; he runs at me like a giant <i>and</i> irresistible warrior.

<p><sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth over my skin <font color='#7a8080'>[as a sign of mourning]</font> and have defiled my horn (my insignia of strength) in the dust.

<p><sup>16</sup> My face is red <i>and</i> swollen with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death <font color='#7a8080'>[my eyes are dimmed]</font>,

<p><sup>17</sup> Although there is no guilt <i>or</i> violence in my hands and my prayer is pure.

<p><sup>18</sup> O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry have no resting-place <font color='#7a8080'>[where it will cease being heard]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, and He who vouches for me is on high.

<p><sup>20</sup> My friends scorn me, but my eye pours out tears to God.

<p><sup>21</sup> Oh, that there might be one who would plead for a man with God <i>and</i> that he would maintain his right with Him, as a son of man pleads with <i>or</i> for his neighbor!

<p><sup>22</sup> For when a few years are come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return.

<h4>17</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> My spirit is broken, my days are spent (snuffed out); the grave is ready for me.

<p><sup>2</sup> Surely there are mockers <i>and</i> mockery around me, and my eye dwells on their obstinacy, insults, <i>and</i> resistance.

<p><sup>3</sup> Give me a pledge with Yourself <font color='#7a8080'>[acknowledge my innocence before my death]</font>; who is there that will give security for me?

<p><sup>4</sup> But their hearts <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord]</font> You have closed to understanding; therefore You will not let them triumph <font color='#7a8080'>[by giving them a verdict against me]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> He who denounces his friends <font color='#7a8080'>[in order to make them]</font> a prey <i>and</i> get a share, the eyes of his children shall fail <font color='#7a8080'>[to find food]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> But He has made me a byword among the people, and they spit before my face.

<p><sup>7</sup> My eye has grown dim because of grief, and all my members are <font color='#7a8080'>[wasted away]</font> like a shadow.

<p><sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonished <i>and</i> appalled at this, and the innocent shall stir himself up against the godless <i>and</i> polluted.

<p><sup>9</sup> Yet shall the righteous (those upright and in right standing with God) hold to their ways, and he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.

<p><sup>10</sup> But as for you, come on again, all of you, though I find not a wise man among you.

<p><sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes <i>and</i> plans are frustrated; even the thoughts (desires and possessions) of my heart <font color='#7a8080'>[are broken off]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> These <font color='#7a8080'>[thoughts]</font> extend from the night into the day, <font color='#7a8080'>[so that]</font> the light is short because of darkness.

<p><sup>13</sup> But if I look to Sheol (the unseen state) as my abode, if I spread my couch in the darkness,

<p><sup>14</sup> If I say to the grave <i>and</i> corruption, You are my father, and to the worm <font color='#7a8080'>[that feeds on decay]</font>, You are my mother and my sister <font color='#7a8080'>[because I will soon be closest to you]</font>,

<p><sup>15</sup> Where then is my hope? And if I have hope, who will see <font color='#7a8080'>[its fulfillment]</font>?

<p><sup>16</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[My hope]</font> shall go down to the bars of Sheol (the unseen state) when once there is rest in the dust.

<h4>18</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> How long will you lay snares for words <i>and</i> have to hunt for your argument? Do some clear thinking, and then we will reply.

<p><sup>3</sup> Why are we counted as beasts <font color='#7a8080'>[as if we had no sense]</font>? Why are we unclean in your sight?

<p><sup>4</sup> You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place?

<p><sup>5</sup> Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine.

<p><sup>6</sup> The light shall be dark in his dwelling, and his lamp beside him shall be put out.

<p><sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength shall be shortened, and his own counsel <i>and</i> the plans in which he trusted shall bring about his downfall.

<p><sup>8</sup> For the wicked is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks upon a lattice-covered pit.

<p><sup>9</sup> A trap will catch him by the heel, and a snare will lay hold on him.

<p><sup>10</sup> A noose is hidden for him on the ground and a trap for him in the way.

<p><sup>11</sup> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall chase him at his heels.

<p><sup>12</sup> The strength <font color='#7a8080'>[of the wicked]</font> shall be hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at his side <font color='#7a8080'>[if he halts]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> By disease his strength <i>and</i> his skin shall be devoured; the firstborn of death <font color='#7a8080'>[the worst of diseases]</font> shall consume his limbs.

<p><sup>14</sup> He shall be rooted out of his dwelling place in which he trusted, and he shall be brought to the king of terrors <font color='#7a8080'>[death]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his <font color='#7a8080'>[family]</font>; sulphur shall be scattered over his dwelling <font color='#7a8080'>[to purify it after his going]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> The roots <font color='#7a8080'>[of the wicked]</font> shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off <i>and</i> wither.

<p><sup>17</sup> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.

<p><sup>18</sup> He shall be thrust from light into darkness and driven out of the world.

<p><sup>19</sup> He shall neither have son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned.

<p><sup>20</sup> They <font color='#7a8080'>[of the west]</font> that come after <font color='#7a8080'>[the wicked man]</font> shall be astonished <i>and</i> appalled at his day, as they <font color='#7a8080'>[of the east]</font> that went before were seized with horror.

<p><sup>21</sup> Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, and such is the place of him who knows not (recognizes not and honors not) God.

<h4>19</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered:

<p><sup>2</sup> How long will you vex <i>and</i> torment me and break me in pieces with words?

<p><sup>3</sup> These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange <font color='#7a8080'>[harden yourselves against me and deal severely with me]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> And if it were true that I have erred, my error would remain with me <font color='#7a8080'>[I would be conscious of it]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach <i>and</i> humiliation,

<p><sup>6</sup> Know that God has overthrown <i>and</i> put me in the wrong and has closed His net about me.

<p><sup>7</sup> Behold, I cry out, Violence! but I am not heard; I cry aloud for help, but there is no justice.

<p><sup>8</sup> He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and He has set darkness upon my paths.

<p><sup>9</sup> He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head.

<p><sup>10</sup> He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope has He pulled up like a tree.

<p><sup>11</sup> He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His adversaries.

<p><sup>12</sup> His troops come together and cast up their way <i>and</i> siege works against me and encamp round about my tent.

<p><sup>13</sup> He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.

<p><sup>14</sup> My kinsfolk have failed me, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.

<p><sup>15</sup> Those who live temporarily in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.

<p><sup>16</sup> I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer, though I beseech him with words.

<p><sup>17</sup> I am repulsive to my wife and loathsome to the children of my own mother.

<p><sup>18</sup> Even young children despise me; when I get up, they speak against me.

<p><sup>19</sup> All the men of my council <i>and</i> my familiar friends abhor me; those whom I loved are turned against me.

<p><sup>20</sup> My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin <i>or</i> gums of my teeth.

<p><sup>21</sup> Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me!

<p><sup>22</sup> Why do you, as if you were God, pursue <i>and</i> persecute me? <font color='#7a8080'>[Acting like wild beasts]</font> why are you not satisfied with my flesh?

<p><sup>23</sup> Oh, that the words I now speak were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book <font color='#7a8080'>[carved on a tablet of stone]</font>!

<p><sup>24</sup> That with an iron pen and <font color='#7a8080'>[molten]</font> lead they were graven in the rock forever!

<p><sup>25</sup> For I know that my Redeemer <i>and</i> Vindicator lives, and at last He <font color='#7a8080'>[the Last One]</font> will stand upon the earth.

<p><sup>26</sup> And after my skin, even this body, has been destroyed, then from my flesh <i>or</i> without it I shall see God,

<p><sup>27</sup> Whom I, even I, shall see for myself <i>and</i> on my side! And my eyes shall behold Him, and not as a stranger! My heart pines away <i>and</i> is consumed within me.

<p><sup>28</sup> If you say, How we will pursue him! <font color='#7a8080'>[and continue to persecute me with the claim]</font> that the root <font color='#7a8080'>[cause]</font> of all these <font color='#7a8080'>[afflictions]</font> is found in me,

<p><sup>29</sup> Then beware <i>and</i> be afraid of the sword <font color='#7a8080'>[of divine vengeance]</font>, for wrathful are the punishments of that sword, that you may know there is a judgment.

<h4>20</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> Therefore do my thoughts give me an answer, and I make haste <font color='#7a8080'>[to offer it]</font> for this reason.

<p><sup>3</sup> I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame, but out of my understanding my spirit answers me.

<p><sup>4</sup> Do you not know from of old, since the time that man was placed on the earth,

<p><sup>5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless <i>and</i> defiled is but for a moment?

<p><sup>6</sup> Though his <font color='#7a8080'>[proud]</font> height mounts up to the heavens and his head reaches to the clouds,

<p><sup>7</sup> Yet he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, Where is he?

<p><sup>8</sup> He will fly away like a dream and will not be found; yes, he will be chased away as a vision of the night.

<p><sup>9</sup> The eye which saw him will see him no more, neither will his <font color='#7a8080'>[accustomed]</font> place any more behold him.

<p><sup>10</sup> The poor will oppress his children, and his hands will give back his <font color='#7a8080'>[ill-gotten]</font> wealth.

<p><sup>11</sup> His bones are full of youthful energy, but it will lie down with him in the dust.

<p><sup>12</sup> Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue,

<p><sup>13</sup> Though he is loath to let it go but keeps it still within his mouth,

<p><sup>14</sup> Yet his food turns <font color='#7a8080'>[to poison]</font> in his stomach; it is the venom of asps within him.

<p><sup>15</sup> He has swallowed down <font color='#7a8080'>[his ill-gotten]</font> riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.

<p><sup>16</sup> He shall suck the poison of asps <font color='#7a8080'>[which ill-gotten wealth contains]</font>; the viper's tongue shall slay him.

<p><sup>17</sup> He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter <font color='#7a8080'>[to enjoy his wealth]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> That which he labored for shall he give back and shall not swallow it down <font color='#7a8080'>[to enjoy it]</font>; according to his wealth shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice in it.

<p><sup>19</sup> For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has violently taken away a house which he did not build.

<p><sup>20</sup> Because his desire <i>and</i> greed knew no quietness within him, he will not save anything of that in which he delights.

<p><sup>21</sup> There was nothing left that he did not devour; therefore his prosperity will not endure.

<p><sup>22</sup> In the fullness of his sufficiency <font color='#7a8080'>[in the time of his great abundance]</font> he shall be poor and in straits; every hand of everyone who is in misery shall come upon him <font color='#7a8080'>[he is but a wretch on every side]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly <font color='#7a8080'>[as in the wilderness when God sent the quails]</font>, God will cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him and will rain it upon him while he is eating.

<p><sup>24</sup> He will flee from the iron weapon, but the bow of bronze shall strike him through.

<p><sup>25</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The arrow]</font> is drawn forth and it comes out after passing through his body; yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors march in upon him;

<p><sup>26</sup> Every misfortune is laid up for his treasures. A fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume what is left in his tent <font color='#7a8080'>[and it shall go ill with him who remains there]</font>.

<p><sup>27</sup> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.

<p><sup>28</sup> The produce <i>and</i> increase of his house will go into exile <font color='#7a8080'>[with the victors]</font>, dragged away in the day of <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> wrath.

<p><sup>29</sup> This is the wicked man's portion from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.

<h4>21</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> Hear diligently my speech, and let this <font color='#7a8080'>[your attention]</font> be your consolation <font color='#7a8080'>[given me]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Allow me, and I also will speak; and after I have spoken, mock on.

<p><sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man <i>or</i> of him? And why should I not be impatient <i>and</i> my spirit be troubled?

<p><sup>5</sup> Look at me and be astonished (appalled); and lay your hand upon your mouth.

<p><sup>6</sup> Even when I remember, I am troubled <i>and</i> afraid; horror <i>and</i> trembling take hold of my flesh.

<p><sup>7</sup> Why do the wicked live, become old, and become mighty in power?

<p><sup>8</sup> Their children are established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes.

<p><sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe <i>and</i> in peace, without fear; neither is the rod of God upon them.

<p><sup>10</sup> Their bull breeds and fails not; their cows calve and do not miscarry.

<p><sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children skip about.

<p><sup>12</sup> They themselves lift up their voices <i>and</i> sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.

<p><sup>13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol (the unseen state) in a moment <i>and</i> peacefully.

<p><sup>14</sup> Yet they say to God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.

<p><sup>15</sup> Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?

<p><sup>16</sup> But notice, <font color='#7a8080'>[you say]</font> the prosperity of the wicked is not in their power; the mystery <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's dealings]</font> with the ungodly is far from my comprehension.

<p><sup>17</sup> How often <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains <i>and</i> sorrows to them in His anger?

<p><sup>18</sup> That they are like stubble before the wind and like chaff that the storm steals <i>and</i> carries away?

<p><sup>19</sup> You say, God lays up <font color='#7a8080'>[the punishment of the wicked man's]</font> iniquity for his children. Let Him recompense it to the man himself, that he may know <i>and</i> feel it.

<p><sup>20</sup> Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

<p><sup>21</sup> For what pleasure <i>or</i> interest has a man in his house <i>and</i> family after he is dead, when the number of his months is cut off?

<p><sup>22</sup> Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing that He judges those who are on high?

<p><sup>23</sup> One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet;

<p><sup>24</sup> His pails are full of milk <font color='#7a8080'>[his veins are filled with nourishment]</font>, and the marrow of his bones is fresh <i>and</i> moist,

<p><sup>25</sup> Whereas another man dies in bitterness of soul and never tastes of pleasure <i>or</i> good fortune.

<p><sup>26</sup> They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm spreads a covering over them.

<p><sup>27</sup> Behold, I know your thoughts <i>and</i> plans and the devices with which you would wrong me.

<p><sup>28</sup> For you say, Where is the house of the rich <i>and</i> liberal prince <font color='#7a8080'>[meaning me]</font>? And where is the tent in which the wicked <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> dwelt?

<p><sup>29</sup> Have you not asked those who travel this way, and do you not accept their testimony <i>and</i> evidences—

<p><sup>30</sup> That the evil man is <font color='#7a8080'>[now]</font> spared in the day of calamity <i>and</i> destruction, and they are led forth <i>and</i> away on the day of <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> wrath?

<p><sup>31</sup> But who declares <font color='#7a8080'>[a man's]</font> way <font color='#7a8080'>[and rebukes]</font> him to his face? And who pays him back for what he has done?

<p><sup>32</sup> When he is borne to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb.

<p><sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley are sweet to him, and every man shall follow him to a grave, as innumerable people <font color='#7a8080'>[have gone]</font> before him.

<p><sup>34</sup> How then can you comfort me with empty <i>and</i> futile words, since in your replies there lurks falsehood?

<h4>22</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font>,

<p><sup>2</sup> Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself.

<p><sup>3</sup> Is it any pleasure <i>or</i> advantage to the Almighty that you are righteous (upright and in right standing with Him)? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?

<p><sup>4</sup> Is it for your <font color='#7a8080'>[reverential]</font> fear of Him that He <font color='#7a8080'>[thus]</font> reproves you, that He enters with you into judgment?

<p><sup>5</sup> Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities.

<p><sup>6</sup> For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.

<p><sup>7</sup> You have not given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.

<p><sup>8</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[you, Job]</font> the man with power possessed the land, and the favored <i>and</i> accepted man dwelt in it.

<p><sup>9</sup> You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.

<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden fear troubles <i>and</i> overwhelms you;

<p><sup>11</sup> Your light is darkened, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.

<p><sup>12</sup> Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore you say, How <i>and</i> what does God know <font color='#7a8080'>[about me]</font>? Can He judge through the thick darkness?

<p><sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so that He does not see, and He walks on the vault of the heavens.

<p><sup>15</sup> Will you pay attention <i>and</i> keep to the old way that wicked men trod <font color='#7a8080'>[in Noah's time]</font>,

<p><sup>16</sup> Men who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out like a stream <font color='#7a8080'>[during the flood]</font>?

<p><sup>17</sup> They said to God, Depart from us, and, What can the Almighty do for <i>or</i> to us?

<p><sup>18</sup> Yet He filled their houses with good <font color='#7a8080'>[things]</font>. But the counsel of the ungodly is far from me.

<p><sup>19</sup> The righteous see it and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn <font color='#7a8080'>[saying]</font>,

<p><sup>20</sup> Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, and that which remained to them the fire has consumed.

<p><sup>21</sup> Acquaint now yourself with Him <font color='#7a8080'>[agree with God and show yourself to be conformed to His will]</font> and be at peace; by that <font color='#7a8080'>[you shall prosper and great]</font> good shall come to you.

<p><sup>22</sup> Receive, I pray you, the law <i>and</i> instruction from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart.

<p><sup>23</sup> If you return to the Almighty <font color='#7a8080'>[and submit and humble yourself before Him]</font>, you will be built up; if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents,

<p><sup>24</sup> If you lay gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brook <font color='#7a8080'>[considering them of little worth]</font>,

<p><sup>25</sup> And make the Almighty your gold and <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> your precious silver treasure,

<p><sup>26</sup> Then you will have delight in the Almighty, and you will lift up your face to God.

<p><sup>27</sup> You will make your prayer to Him, and He will hear you, and you will pay your vows.

<p><sup>28</sup> You shall also decide <i>and</i> decree a thing, and it shall be established for you; and the light <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's favor]</font> shall shine upon your ways.

<p><sup>29</sup> When they make <font color='#7a8080'>[you]</font> low, you will say, <font color='#7a8080'>[There is]</font> a lifting up; and the humble person He lifts up <i>and</i> saves.

<p><sup>30</sup> He will even deliver the one <font color='#7a8080'>[for whom you intercede]</font> who is not innocent; yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.

<h4>23</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> Even today is my complaint rebellious <i>and</i> bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

<p><sup>3</sup> Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His seat!

<p><sup>4</sup> I would lay my cause before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.

<p><sup>5</sup> I would learn what He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me.

<p><sup>6</sup> Would He plead against me with His great power? No, He would give heed to me.

<p><sup>7</sup> There the righteous <font color='#7a8080'>[one who is upright and in right standing with God]</font> could reason with Him; so I should be acquitted by my Judge forever.

<p><sup>8</sup> Behold, I go forward <font color='#7a8080'>[and to the east]</font>, but He is not there; I go backward <font color='#7a8080'>[and to the west]</font>, but I cannot perceive Him;

<p><sup>9</sup> On the left hand <font color='#7a8080'>[and to the north]</font> where He works <font color='#7a8080'>[I seek Him]</font>, but I cannot behold Him; He turns Himself to the right hand <font color='#7a8080'>[and to the south]</font>, but I cannot see Him.

<p><sup>10</sup> But He knows the way that I take <font color='#7a8080'>[He has concern for it, appreciates, and pays attention to it]</font>. When He has tried me, I shall come forth as refined gold <font color='#7a8080'>[pure and luminous]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> My foot has held fast to His steps; His ways have I kept and not turned aside.

<p><sup>12</sup> I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have esteemed <i>and</i> treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.

<p><sup>13</sup> But He is unchangeable, and who can turn Him? And what He wants to do, that He does.

<p><sup>14</sup> For He performs <font color='#7a8080'>[that which He has]</font> planned for me, and of many such matters He is mindful.

<p><sup>15</sup> Therefore am I troubled <i>and</i> terrified at His presence; when I consider, I am in dread <i>and</i> afraid of Him.

<p><sup>16</sup> For God has made my heart faint, timid, <i>and</i> broken, and the Almighty has terrified me,

<p><sup>17</sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness <font color='#7a8080'>[of these woes befell me]</font>, neither has He covered the thick darkness from my face.

<h4>24</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Why <font color='#7a8080'>[seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty]</font> does He not set seasons for judgment? Why do those who know Him see not His days <font color='#7a8080'>[for punishment of the wicked]</font>?

<p><sup>2</sup> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks and pasture them <font color='#7a8080'>[appropriating land and flocks openly]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge.

<p><sup>4</sup> They crowd the poor <i>and</i> needy off the road; the poor <i>and</i> meek of the earth all hide themselves.

<p><sup>5</sup> Behold, as wild asses in the desert, <font color='#7a8080'>[the poor]</font> go forth to their work, seeking diligently for prey <i>and</i> food; the wilderness yields them bread for their children <font color='#7a8080'>[in roots and herbage]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> They reap each one his fodder in a field <font color='#7a8080'>[that is not his own]</font>, and they glean the vintage of the wicked man.

<p><sup>7</sup> They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.

<p><sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains and cling to the rock for want of shelter.

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The violent men whose wickedness seems unnoticed]</font> pluck the fatherless infants from the breast <font color='#7a8080'>[to sell or make them slaves]</font>, and take <font color='#7a8080'>[the clothing on]</font> the poor for a pledge,

<p><sup>10</sup> So that the needy go about naked for lack of clothing, and though hungry, they must carry <font color='#7a8080'>[but not eat from]</font> the sheaves.

<p><sup>11</sup> Among the olive rows <font color='#7a8080'>[of the wicked, the poor]</font> make oil; they tread <font color='#7a8080'>[the fresh juice of the grape from]</font> the presses, but suffer thirst.

<p><sup>12</sup> From out of the populous city men groan, and the very life of the wounded cries for help; yet God <font color='#7a8080'>[seemingly]</font> regards not the wrong done them.

<p><sup>13</sup> These wrongdoers are of those who rebel against the light; they know not its ways nor stay in its paths.

<p><sup>14</sup> The murderer rises with the light; he kills the poor and the needy, and in the night he becomes as a thief.

<p><sup>15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me, and he puts a disguise upon his face.

<p><sup>16</sup> In the dark, they dig through <font color='#7a8080'>[the penetrable walls of]</font> houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the sunlight.

<p><sup>17</sup> For midnight is morning to all of them; for they are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness.

<p><sup>18</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[You say]</font> Swiftly such men pass away on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; <font color='#7a8080'>[no treader]</font> turns into their vineyards.

<p><sup>19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so does Sheol (the place of the dead) those who have sinned.

<p><sup>20</sup> The womb shall forget him, the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered, and unrighteousness shall be broken like a tree <font color='#7a8080'>[which cannot be healed]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The evil man]</font> preys upon the barren, childless woman and does no good to the widow.

<p><sup>22</sup> Yet <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> prolongs the life of the <font color='#7a8080'>[wicked]</font> mighty by His power; they rise up when they had despaired of life.

<p><sup>23</sup> God gives them security, and they rest on it; and His eyes are upon their ways.

<p><sup>24</sup> They are exalted for a little while, and then are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others are and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.

<p><sup>25</sup> And if this is not so, who will prove me a liar and make my speech worthless?

<h4>25</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> Dominion and fear are with <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font>; He makes peace in His high places.

<p><sup>3</sup> Is there any number to His armies? And upon whom does not His light arise?

<p><sup>4</sup> How then can man be justified <i>and</i> righteous before God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be pure <i>and</i> clean?

<p><sup>5</sup> Behold, even the moon has no brightness <font color='#7a8080'>[compared to God's glory]</font> and the stars are not pure in His sight—

<p><sup>6</sup> How much less man, who is a maggot! And a son of man, who is a worm!

<h4>26</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> But Job answered,

<p><sup>2</sup> How you have helped him who is without power! How you have sustained the arm that is without strength!

<p><sup>3</sup> How you have counseled him who has no wisdom! And how plentifully you have declared to him sound knowledge!

<p><sup>4</sup> With whose assistance have you uttered these words? And whose spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[inspired what]</font> came forth from you?

<p><sup>5</sup> The shades of the dead tremble underneath the waters and their inhabitants.

<p><sup>6</sup> Sheol (the place of the dead) is naked before God, and Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering <font color='#7a8080'>[from His eyes]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> He it is Who spreads out the northern skies over emptiness and hangs the earth upon <i>or</i> over nothing.

<p><sup>8</sup> He holds the waters bound in His clouds <font color='#7a8080'>[which otherwise would spill on earth all at once]</font>, and the cloud is not rent under them.

<p><sup>9</sup> He covers the face of His throne and spreads over it His cloud.

<p><sup>10</sup> He has placed an enclosing limit <font color='#7a8080'>[the horizon]</font> upon the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.

<p><sup>11</sup> The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at His rebuke.

<p><sup>12</sup> He stills <i>or</i> stirs up the sea by His power, and by His understanding He smites proud Rahab.

<p><sup>13</sup> By His breath the heavens are garnished; His hand pierced the <font color='#7a8080'>[swiftly]</font> fleeing serpent.

<p><sup>14</sup> Yet these are but <font color='#7a8080'>[a small part of His doings]</font> the outskirts of His ways <i>or</i> the mere fringes of His force, the faintest whisper of His voice! Who dares contemplate <i>or</i> who can understand the thunders of His full, magnificent power?

<h4>27</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Job again took up his discourse and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> As God lives, Who has taken away my right <i>and</i> denied me justice, and the Almighty, Who has vexed <i>and</i> embittered my life,

<p><sup>3</sup> As long as my life is still whole within me, and the breath of God is <font color='#7a8080'>[yet]</font> in my nostrils,

<p><sup>4</sup> My lips shall not speak untruth, nor shall my tongue utter deceit.

<p><sup>5</sup> God forbid that I should justify you—saying you are right <font color='#7a8080'>[in your accusations against me]</font>; till I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.

<p><sup>6</sup> My uprightness <i>and</i> my right standing with God I hold fast and will not let them go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days <i>and</i> it shall not reproach me as long as I live.

<p><sup>7</sup> Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.

<p><sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the godless <i>and</i> polluted, even though he has gained <font color='#7a8080'>[in this world]</font>, when God cuts him off <i>and</i> takes away his life?

<p><sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?

<p><sup>10</sup> Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?

<p><sup>11</sup> I will teach you regarding the hand <i>and</i> handiwork of God; that which is with the Almighty <font color='#7a8080'>[God's actual treatment of the wicked man]</font> will I not conceal.

<p><sup>12</sup> Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain <font color='#7a8080'>[cherishing foolish notions]</font>?

<p><sup>13</sup> This <font color='#7a8080'>[which I am about to tell]</font> is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage which oppressors shall receive from the Almighty:

<p><sup>14</sup> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring will not have sufficient bread.

<p><sup>15</sup> Those who survive him, <font color='#7a8080'>[the pestilence]</font> will bury, and <font color='#7a8080'>[their]</font> widows will make no lamentation.

<p><sup>16</sup> Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up clothing like clay,

<p><sup>17</sup> He may prepare it, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.

<p><sup>18</sup> He builds his house like a moth <i>or</i> a spider, like a booth which a watchman makes <font color='#7a8080'>[to last for a season]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The wicked]</font> will lie down rich, but does it not again; he opens his eyes, and <font color='#7a8080'>[his wealth]</font> is gone.

<p><sup>20</sup> Terrors overtake him like a <font color='#7a8080'>[suddenly loosened]</font> flood; a windstorm steals him away in the night.

<p><sup>21</sup> The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.

<p><sup>22</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[God and the storm]</font> hurl at him without pity <i>and</i> unsparingly <font color='#7a8080'>[their thunderbolts of wrath]</font>; he flees in haste before His power.

<p><sup>23</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God causes]</font> men to clap their hands at him <font color='#7a8080'>[in malignant joy]</font> and hiss him out of his place.

<h4>28</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold where they refine it.

<p><sup>2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the stone ore.

<p><sup>3</sup> Man sets an end to darkness, and he searches out the farthest bounds for the ore buried in gloom and deep darkness.

<p><sup>4</sup> Men break open shafts away from where people sojourn, in places forgotten by <font color='#7a8080'>[human]</font> foot; and <font color='#7a8080'>[descend into them]</font>, hanging afar from men, they swing <i>or</i> flit to and fro.

<p><sup>5</sup> As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath <font color='#7a8080'>[its surface, down deep in the mine]</font> there is blasting, turning it up as by fire.

<p><sup>6</sup> Its stones are the bed of sapphires; it holds dust of gold <font color='#7a8080'>[which he wins]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it.

<p><sup>8</sup> The proud beasts <font color='#7a8080'>[and their young]</font> have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it.

<p><sup>9</sup> Man puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots.

<p><sup>10</sup> He cuts out channels <i>and</i> passages among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing.

<p><sup>11</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Man]</font> binds the streams so that they do not trickle <font color='#7a8080'>[into the mine]</font>, and the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light.

<p><sup>12</sup> But where shall Wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?

<p><sup>13</sup> Man knows not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living.

<p><sup>14</sup> The deep says, <font color='#7a8080'>[Wisdom]</font> is not in me; and the sea says, It is not with me.

<p><sup>15</sup> It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it.

<p><sup>16</sup> It cannot be valued in <font color='#7a8080'>[terms of]</font> the gold of Ophir, in the precious onyx <i>or</i> beryl, or the sapphire.

<p><sup>17</sup> Gold and glass cannot equal <font color='#7a8080'>[Wisdom]</font>, nor can it be exchanged for jewels <i>or</i> vessels of fine gold.

<p><sup>18</sup> No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; for the possession of Wisdom is even above rubies <i>or</i> pearls.

<p><sup>19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.

<p><sup>20</sup> From where then does Wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?

<p><sup>21</sup> It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and knowledge of it is withheld from the birds of the heavens.

<p><sup>22</sup> Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say, We have <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> heard the report of it with our ears.

<p><sup>23</sup> God understands the way <font color='#7a8080'>[to Wisdom]</font> and He knows the place of it <font color='#7a8080'>[Wisdom is with God alone]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.

<p><sup>25</sup> When He gave to the wind weight <i>or</i> pressure and allotted the waters by measure,

<p><sup>26</sup> When He made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder,

<p><sup>27</sup> Then He saw <font color='#7a8080'>[Wisdom]</font> and declared it; He established it, yes, and searched it out <font color='#7a8080'>[for His own use, and He alone possesses it]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> But to man He said, Behold, the reverential <i>and</i> worshipful fear of the Lord—that is Wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

<h4>29</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And Job again took up his discussion and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,

<p><sup>3</sup> When His lamp shone above <i>and</i> upon my head and by His light I walked through darkness;

<p><sup>4</sup> As I was in the <font color='#7a8080'>[prime]</font> ripeness of my days, when the friendship <i>and</i> counsel of God were over my tent,

<p><sup>5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me and my children were about me,

<p><sup>6</sup> When my steps <font color='#7a8080'>[through rich pasturage]</font> were washed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!

<p><sup>7</sup> When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the street <font color='#7a8080'>[the broad place for the council at the city's gate]</font>,

<p><sup>8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves; the aged rose up <i>and</i> stood;

<p><sup>9</sup> The princes refrained from talking and laid their hands on their mouths;

<p><sup>10</sup> The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues cleaved to the roof of their mouths.

<p><sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard, it called me happy <i>and</i> blessed me; and when the eye saw, it testified for me <font color='#7a8080'>[approvingly]</font>,

<p><sup>12</sup> Because I delivered the poor who cried, the fatherless and him who had none to help him.

<p><sup>13</sup> The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

<p><sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me <i>or</i> clothed itself with me; my justice was like a robe and a turban <i>or</i> a diadem <i>or</i> a crown!

<p><sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

<p><sup>16</sup> I was a father to the poor <i>and</i> needy; the cause of him I did not know I searched out.

<p><sup>17</sup> And I broke the jaws <i>or</i> the big teeth of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth.

<p><sup>18</sup> Then I said, I shall die in <i>or</i> beside my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.

<p><sup>19</sup> My root is spread out <i>and</i> open to the waters, and the dew lies all night upon my branch.

<p><sup>20</sup> My glory <i>and</i> honor are fresh in me <font color='#7a8080'>[being constantly renewed]</font>, and my bow gains <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> new strength in my hand.

<p><sup>21</sup> Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel.

<p><sup>22</sup> After I spoke, they did not speak again, and my speech dropped upon them <font color='#7a8080'>[like a refreshing shower]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the spring rain.

<p><sup>24</sup> I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and their depression did not cast down the light of my countenance.

<p><sup>25</sup> I chose their way <font color='#7a8080'>[for them]</font> and sat as <font color='#7a8080'>[their]</font> chief, and dwelt like a king among his soldiers, like one who comforts mourners.

<h4>30</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> But now they who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.

<p><sup>2</sup> Yes, how could the strength of their hands profit me? They were men whose ripe age <i>and</i> vigor had perished.

<p><sup>3</sup> They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry <i>and</i> barren ground <i>or</i> flee into the wilderness, into the gloom of wasteness and desolation.

<p><sup>4</sup> They pluck saltwort <i>or</i> mallows among the bushes, and roots of the broom for their food <i>or</i> to warm them.

<p><sup>5</sup> They are driven from among men, who shout after them as after a thief.

<p><sup>6</sup> They must dwell in the clefts of frightful valleys (gullies made by torrents) and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.

<p><sup>7</sup> Among the bushes they bray <i>and</i> howl <font color='#7a8080'>[like wild animals]</font>; beneath the prickly scrub they fling themselves <i>and</i> huddle together.

<p><sup>8</sup> Sons of the worthless and nameless, they have been scourged <i>and</i> crushed out of the land.

<p><sup>9</sup> And now I have become their song; yes, I am a byword to them.

<p><sup>10</sup> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and do not refrain from spitting in my face <i>or</i> at the sight of me.

<p><sup>11</sup> For God has loosed my bowstring and afflicted <i>and</i> humbled me; they have cast off the bridle <font color='#7a8080'>[of restraint]</font> before me.

<p><sup>12</sup> On my right hand rises the rabble brood; they jostle me <i>and</i> push away my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction <font color='#7a8080'>[like an advancing army]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> They break up <i>and</i> clutter my path <font color='#7a8080'>[embarrassing my plans]</font>; they urge on my calamity, even though they have no helper <font color='#7a8080'>[and are themselves helpless]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> As through a wide breach they come in; amid the crash <font color='#7a8080'>[of falling walls]</font> they roll themselves upon me.

<p><sup>15</sup> Terrors are turned upon me; my honor <i>and</i> reputation they chase away like the wind, and my welfare has passed away as a cloud.

<p><sup>16</sup> And now my life is poured out within me; the days of affliction have gripped me.

<p><sup>17</sup> My bones are pierced <font color='#7a8080'>[with aching]</font> in the night season, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.

<p><sup>18</sup> By the great force <font color='#7a8080'>[of my disease]</font> my garment is disguised <i>and</i> disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my coat.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.

<p><sup>20</sup> I cry to You, <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord,]</font> and You do not answer me; I stand up, but You <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> gaze <font color='#7a8080'>[indifferently]</font> at me.

<p><sup>21</sup> You have become harsh <i>and</i> cruel to me; with the might of Your hand You <font color='#7a8080'>[keep me alive only to]</font> persecute me.

<p><sup>22</sup> You lift me up on the wind; You cause me to ride upon it, and You toss me about in the tempest.

<p><sup>23</sup> For I know that You will bring me to death and to the house <font color='#7a8080'>[of meeting]</font> appointed for all the living.

<p><sup>24</sup> However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand? Or in his calamity will he not therefore cry for help?

<p><sup>25</sup> Did not I weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my heart grieved for the poor <i>and</i> needy?

<p><sup>26</sup> But when I looked for good, then evil came to me; and when I waited for light, there came darkness.

<p><sup>27</sup> My heart is troubled and does not rest; days of affliction come to meet me.

<p><sup>28</sup> I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the congregation and cry for help.

<p><sup>29</sup> I am a brother to jackals <font color='#7a8080'>[which howl]</font>, and a companion to ostriches <font color='#7a8080'>[which scream dismally]</font>.

<p><sup>30</sup> My skin falls from me in blackened flakes, and my bones are burned with heat.

<p><sup>31</sup> Therefore my lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.

<h4>31</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> I dictated a covenant (an agreement) to my eyes; how then could I look <font color='#7a8080'>[lustfully]</font> upon a girl?

<p><sup>2</sup> For what portion should I have from God above <font color='#7a8080'>[if I were lewd]</font>, and what heritage from the Almighty on high?

<p><sup>3</sup> Does not calamity <font color='#7a8080'>[justly]</font> befall the unrighteous, and disaster the workers of iniquity?

<p><sup>4</sup> Does not <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> see my ways and count all my steps?

<p><sup>5</sup> If I have walked with falsehood <i>or</i> vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit—

<p><sup>6</sup> Oh, let me be weighed in a just balance <i>and</i> let Him weigh me, that God may know my integrity!

<p><sup>7</sup> If my step has turned out of <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> way, and my heart has gone the way my eyes <font color='#7a8080'>[covetously]</font> invited, and if any spot has stained my hands with guilt,

<p><sup>8</sup> Then let me sow and let another eat; yes, let the produce of my field <i>or</i> my offspring be rooted out.

<p><sup>9</sup> If my heart has been deceived <i>and</i> I made a fool by a woman, or if I have <font color='#7a8080'>[covetously]</font> laid wait at my neighbor's door <font color='#7a8080'>[until his departure]</font>,

<p><sup>10</sup> Then let my wife grind <font color='#7a8080'>[meal, like a bondslave]</font> for another, and let others bow down upon her.

<p><sup>11</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[adultery]</font> is a heinous <i>and</i> chief crime, an iniquity <font color='#7a8080'>[to demand action by]</font> the judges <i>and</i> punishment.

<p><sup>12</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[uncontrolled passion]</font> is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (to destruction, ruin, and the place of final torment); <font color='#7a8080'>[that fire once lighted would rage until all is consumed]</font> and would burn to the root all my <font color='#7a8080'>[life's]</font> increase.

<p><sup>13</sup> If I have despised <i>and</i> rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they contended <i>or</i> brought a complaint against me,

<p><sup>14</sup> What then shall I do when God rises up <font color='#7a8080'>[to judge]</font>? When He visits <font color='#7a8080'>[to inquire of me]</font>, what shall I answer Him?

<p><sup>15</sup> Did not He Who made me in the womb make <font color='#7a8080'>[my servant]</font>? And did not One fashion us both in the womb?

<p><sup>16</sup> If I have withheld from the poor <i>and</i> needy what they desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain <font color='#7a8080'>[for relief]</font>,

<p><sup>17</sup> Or have eaten my morsel alone and have not shared it with the fatherless—

<p><sup>18</sup> No, but from my youth <font color='#7a8080'>[the fatherless]</font> grew up with me as a father, and I have been <font color='#7a8080'>[the widow's]</font> guide from my mother's womb—

<p><sup>19</sup> If I have seen anyone perish for want of clothing, or any poor person without covering,

<p><sup>20</sup> If his loins have not blessed me <font color='#7a8080'>[for clothing them]</font>, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,

<p><sup>21</sup> If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless when I saw <font color='#7a8080'>[that the judges would be favorable and be]</font> my help at the <font color='#7a8080'>[council]</font> gate,

<p><sup>22</sup> Then let my shoulder fall away from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its socket.

<p><sup>23</sup> For calamity from God was a terror to me, and because of His majesty I could not endure <font color='#7a8080'>[to face Him]</font> <i>and</i> could do nothing.

<p><sup>24</sup> If I have made gold my trust <i>and</i> hope or have said to fine gold, You are my confidence,

<p><sup>25</sup> If I rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my <font color='#7a8080'>[powerful]</font> hand <font color='#7a8080'>[alone]</font> had gotten much,

<p><sup>26</sup> If I beheld <font color='#7a8080'>[as an object of worship]</font> the sunlight when it shone or the moon walking in its brightness,

<p><sup>27</sup> And my heart has been secretly enticed by them or my mouth has kissed my hand <font color='#7a8080'>[in homage to them]</font>,

<p><sup>28</sup> This also would have been <font color='#7a8080'>[a heinous and principal]</font> iniquity to demand the judges' action <i>and</i> punishment, for I would have denied <i>and</i> been false to the God Who is above.

<p><sup>29</sup> If I rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me or lifted myself up <font color='#7a8080'>[in malicious triumph]</font> when evil overtook him—

<p><sup>30</sup> No, I have let my mouth sin neither by cursing my enemy nor by praying that he might die—

<p><sup>31</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Just ask]</font> if the men of my tent will not say, Who can find one in need who has not been satisfied with food he gave them?—

<p><sup>32</sup> The temporary resident has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my door to the wayfaring man—

<p><sup>33</sup> If like Adam <i>or</i> like <font color='#7a8080'>[other]</font> men I have concealed my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom

<p><sup>34</sup> Because I feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence and did not go out of the door—

<p><sup>35</sup> Oh, for a hearing! Oh, for an answer from the Almighty! Let my adversary write out His indictment <font color='#7a8080'>[and put His vague accusations in tangible form]</font> in a book!

<p><sup>36</sup> Surely I would <font color='#7a8080'>[proudly]</font> bear it on my shoulder and wind the scroll about my head as a diadem.

<p><sup>37</sup> I would count out to Him the number of my steps <font color='#7a8080'>[with every detail of my life]</font>, approaching His presence as a prince—

<p><sup>38</sup> For if my land has cried out against me and its furrows have complained together with tears <font color='#7a8080'>[that I have no right to them]</font>,

<p><sup>39</sup> If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them or have caused its <font color='#7a8080'>[rightful]</font> owners to breathe their last,

<p><sup>40</sup> Let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockleburs instead of barley. The <font color='#7a8080'>[controversial]</font> words of Job <font color='#7a8080'>[with his friends]</font> are ended.

<h4>32</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was <font color='#7a8080'>[rigidly]</font> righteous (upright and in right standing with God) in his own eyes. <font color='#7a8080'>[But there was a fifth man there also.]</font>

<p><sup>2</sup> Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God <font color='#7a8080'>[even made himself out to be better than God]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Also against <font color='#7a8080'>[Job's]</font> three friends was <font color='#7a8080'>[Elihu's]</font> anger kindled, because they had found no answer <font color='#7a8080'>[were unable to show his real error]</font>, and yet they had declared him to be in the wrong <font color='#7a8080'>[and responsible for his own afflictions]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.

<p><sup>5</sup> But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said, I am young, and you are aged; for that reason I was timid <i>and</i> restrained and dared not declare my opinion to you.

<p><sup>7</sup> I said, Age should speak, and a multitude of years should teach wisdom <font color='#7a8080'>[so let it be heard]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> But there is <font color='#7a8080'>[a vital force]</font> a spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[of intelligence]</font> in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives men understanding.

<p><sup>9</sup> It is not the great <font color='#7a8080'>[necessarily]</font> who are wise, nor <font color='#7a8080'>[always]</font> the aged who understand justice.

<p><sup>10</sup> So I say, Listen to me; I also will give you my opinion <font color='#7a8080'>[about Job's situation]</font> <i>and</i> my knowledge.

<p><sup>11</sup> You see, I waited for your words, I listened to your wise reasons, while you searched out what to say.

<p><sup>12</sup> Yes, I paid attention to what you said, and behold, not one of you convinced Job or made <font color='#7a8080'>[satisfactory]</font> replies to his words <font color='#7a8080'>[you could not refute him]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Beware lest you say, We have found wisdom; God thrusts <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> down <font color='#7a8080'>[justly]</font>, not man <font color='#7a8080'>[God alone is dealing with him]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> Now <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> has not directed his words against me <font color='#7a8080'>[therefore I have no cause for irritation]</font>, neither will I answer him with speeches like yours. <font color='#7a8080'>[I speak for truth, not for revenge.]</font>

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Job's friends]</font> are amazed <i>and</i> embarrassed, they answer no more; they have not a thing to say <font color='#7a8080'>[reports Elihu]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> And shall I wait, because they say nothing but stand still and answer no more?

<p><sup>17</sup> I also will answer my <font color='#7a8080'>[God-assigned]</font> part; I also will declare my opinion <i>and</i> my knowledge.

<p><sup>18</sup> For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.

<p><sup>19</sup> My breast is as wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.

<p><sup>20</sup> I must speak, that I may get relief <i>and</i> be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.

<p><sup>21</sup> I will not <font color='#7a8080'>[I warn you]</font> be influenced by respect for any man's person <i>and</i> show partiality, neither will I flatter any man.

<p><sup>22</sup> For I know not how to flatter, <font color='#7a8080'>[wasting my time in mere formalities, for then]</font> my Maker would soon take me away.

<h4>33</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Be that as it may, Job, I beg of you to hear what I have to say and give heed to all my words.

<p><sup>2</sup> Behold, here I am with open mouth; here is my tongue talking.

<p><sup>3</sup> My words shall express the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall speak what they know with utter sincerity.

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[It is]</font> the Spirit of God that made me <font color='#7a8080'>[which has stirred me up]</font>, and the breath of the Almighty that gives me life <font color='#7a8080'>[which inspires me]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> Answer me now, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand.

<p><sup>6</sup> Behold, I am toward God <i>and</i> before Him even as you are; I also am formed out of the clay <font color='#7a8080'>[though I speak with abnormal wisdom because of a divine illumination]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> See my terror <font color='#7a8080'>[for I am only a fellow mortal, not God]</font>; I shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon you.

<p><sup>8</sup> Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying,

<p><sup>9</sup> I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.

<p><sup>10</sup> But behold, God finds occasions against me <i>and</i> causes of alienation <i>and</i> indifference; He counts me as His enemy.

<p><sup>11</sup> He puts my feet in the stocks; He <font color='#7a8080'>[untrustingly]</font> watches all my paths <font color='#7a8080'>[you say]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> I reply to you, Behold, in this you are not just; God is superior to man.

<p><sup>13</sup> Why do you contend against Him? For He does not give account of any of His actions. <font color='#7a8080'>[Sufficient for us it should be to know that it is He Who does them.]</font>

<p><sup>14</sup> For God <font color='#7a8080'>[does reveal His will; He]</font> speaks not only once, but more than once, even though men do not regard it <font color='#7a8080'>[including you, Job]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[One may hear God's voice]</font> in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men while slumbering upon the bed,

<p><sup>16</sup> Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction <font color='#7a8080'>[terrifying them with warnings]</font>,

<p><sup>17</sup> That He may withdraw man from his purpose and cut off pride from him <font color='#7a8080'>[disgusting him with his own disappointing self-sufficiency]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> He holds him back from the pit <font color='#7a8080'>[of destruction]</font>, and his life from perishing by the sword <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's destructive judgments]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God's voice may be heard by man when]</font> he is chastened with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones <i>or</i> while all his bones are firmly set,

<p><sup>20</sup> So that his desire makes him loathe food, and even dainty dishes <font color='#7a8080'>[nauseate him]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.

<p><sup>22</sup> Yes, his soul draws near to corruption, and his life to the inflicters of death (the destroyers).

<p><sup>23</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God's voice may be heard]</font> if there is for the hearer a messenger <i>or</i> an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him <font color='#7a8080'>[how to be upright and in right standing with God]</font>,

<p><sup>24</sup> Then <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> is gracious to him and says, Deliver him from going down into the pit <font color='#7a8080'>[of destruction]</font>; I have found a ransom (a price of redemption, an atonement)!

<p><sup>25</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Then the man's]</font> flesh shall be restored; it becomes fresher <i>and</i> more tender than a child's; he returns to the days of his youth.

<p><sup>26</sup> He prays to God, and He is favorable to him, so that he sees His face with joy; for <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> restores to him his righteousness (his uprightness and right standing with God—with its joys).

<p><sup>27</sup> He looks upon other men <i>or</i> sings out to them, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me, <i>or</i> He did not requite me <font color='#7a8080'>[according to my iniquity]</font>!

<p><sup>28</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> has redeemed my life from going down to the pit <font color='#7a8080'>[of destruction]</font>, and my life shall see the light!

<p><sup>29</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Elihu comments]</font> Behold, God does all these things twice, yes, three times, with a man,

<p><sup>30</sup> To bring back his life from the pit <font color='#7a8080'>[of destruction]</font>, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

<p><sup>31</sup> Give heed, O Job, listen to me; hold your peace, and I will speak.

<p><sup>32</sup> If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.

<p><sup>33</sup> If <font color='#7a8080'>[you do]</font> not <font color='#7a8080'>[have anything to say]</font>, listen to me; hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.

<h4>34</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Elihu answered (continued his discourse) and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who have <font color='#7a8080'>[so much]</font> knowledge.

<p><sup>3</sup> For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food.

<p><sup>4</sup> Let us choose for ourselves that which is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.

<p><sup>5</sup> For Job has said, I am <font color='#7a8080'>[innocent and uncompromisingly]</font> righteous, but God has taken away my right;

<p><sup>6</sup> Would I lie against my right? Yet, notwithstanding my right, I am counted a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.

<p><sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing <i>and</i> scorning like water,

<p><sup>8</sup> Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity and walks with wicked men?

<p><sup>9</sup> For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God <i>and</i> consent to Him.

<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore hear me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God that He should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that He should commit iniquity.

<p><sup>11</sup> For according to the deeds of a man God will <font color='#7a8080'>[exactly]</font> proportion his pay, and He will cause every man to find <font color='#7a8080'>[recompense]</font> according to his ways.

<p><sup>12</sup> Truly God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice.

<p><sup>13</sup> Who put <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> in charge over the earth? Or who laid on Him the whole world?

<p><sup>14</sup> If <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> should set His heart upon him <font color='#7a8080'>[man]</font> and withdraw His <font color='#7a8080'>[life-giving]</font> spirit and His breath <font color='#7a8080'>[from man]</font> to Himself,

<p><sup>15</sup> All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.

<p><sup>16</sup> If now you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.

<p><sup>17</sup> Is it possible that an enemy of right should govern? And will you condemn Him Who is just <i>and</i> mighty?

<p><sup>18</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> Who says to a king, You are worthless <i>and</i> vile, or to princes <i>and</i> nobles, You are ungodly <i>and</i> evil?

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> is not partial to princes, nor does He regard the rich more than the poor, for they all are the work of His hands.

<p><sup>20</sup> In a moment they die; even at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no <font color='#7a8080'>[human]</font> hand.

<p><sup>21</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> eyes are upon the ways of a man, and He sees all his steps.

<p><sup>22</sup> There is no darkness nor thick gloom where the evildoers may hide themselves.

<p><sup>23</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> sets before man no appointed time, that he should appear before <font color='#7a8080'>[Him]</font> in judgment.

<p><sup>24</sup> He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry <font color='#7a8080'>[before a jury]</font> <i>and</i> in ways past finding out and sets others in their stead.

<p><sup>25</sup> Therefore He takes knowledge of their works, and He overturns them in the night, so that they are crushed <i>and</i> destroyed.

<p><sup>26</sup> God strikes them down as wicked men in the open sight of beholders,

<p><sup>27</sup> Because they turned aside from Him and would not consider <i>or</i> show regard for any of His ways,

<p><sup>28</sup> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, and He heard the cry of the afflicted.

<p><sup>29</sup> When He gives quietness (peace and security from oppression), who then can condemn? When He hides His face <font color='#7a8080'>[withdrawing His favor and help]</font>, who then can behold Him <font color='#7a8080'>[and make Him gracious]</font>, whether it be a nation or a man by himself?—

<p><sup>30</sup> That the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people.

<p><sup>31</sup> For has anyone said to God, I have borne my chastisement; I will not offend any more;

<p><sup>32</sup> Teach me what I do not see <font color='#7a8080'>[in regard to how I have sinned]</font>; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?

<p><sup>33</sup> Should <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> recompense <font color='#7a8080'>[for your sins]</font> be as you will it, when you refuse to accept it? For you must do the choosing, and not I; therefore say what is your truthful conclusion.

<p><sup>34</sup> Men of understanding will tell me, indeed, every wise man who hears me <font color='#7a8080'>[will agree]</font>,

<p><sup>35</sup> That Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom <i>and</i> insight.

<p><sup>36</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Would that Job's afflictions be continued and]</font> he be tried to the end because of his answering like wicked men!

<p><sup>37</sup> For he adds rebellion <font color='#7a8080'>[in his unsubmissive, defiant attitude toward God]</font> to his unacknowledged sin; he claps his hands <font color='#7a8080'>[in open mockery and contempt of God]</font> among us, and he multiplies his words of accusation against God.

<h4>35</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Elihu spoke further <font color='#7a8080'>[to Job]</font> and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> Do you think this is your right, <i>or</i> are you saying, My righteousness is more than God's,

<p><sup>3</sup> That you ask, What advantage have you? How am I profited more than if I had sinned?

<p><sup>4</sup> I will answer you and your companions with you.

<p><sup>5</sup> Look to the heavens and see; and behold the skies which are higher than you.

<p><sup>6</sup> If you have sinned, how does that affect God? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what have you done to Him?

<p><sup>7</sup> If you are righteous, what do you <font color='#7a8080'>[by that]</font> give God? Or what does He receive from your hand?

<p><sup>8</sup> Your wickedness touches and affects a man such as you are, and your righteousness is for yourself, one of the human race <font color='#7a8080'>[but it cannot touch God, Who is above such influence]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> Because of the multitudes of oppressions the people cry out; they cry for help because of the violence of the mighty.

<p><sup>10</sup> But no one says, Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs of rejoicing in the night,

<p><sup>11</sup> Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?

<p><sup>12</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The people]</font> cry out because of the pride of evil men, but He does not answer.

<p><sup>13</sup> Surely God will refuse to answer <font color='#7a8080'>[the cry which is]</font> vanity (vain and empty—instead of abiding trust); neither will the Almighty regard it—

<p><sup>14</sup> How much less when <font color='#7a8080'>[missing His righteous judgment on earth]</font> you say that you do not see Him, that your cause is before Him, and you are waiting for Him!

<p><sup>15</sup> But now because God has not <font color='#7a8080'>[speedily]</font> punished in His anger and seems to be unaware of the wrong <i>and</i> oppression <font color='#7a8080'>[of which a person is guilty]</font>,

<p><sup>16</sup> Job uselessly opens his mouth and multiplies words without knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked]</font>.

<h4>36</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Elihu proceeded and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> Bear with me <i>and</i> wait a little longer, and I will show you, for I have something still to say on God's behalf.

<p><sup>3</sup> I will bring my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

<p><sup>4</sup> For truly my words shall not be false; He Who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

<p><sup>5</sup> Behold! God is mighty, and yet despises no one nor regards anything as trivial; He is mighty in power of understanding <i>and</i> heart.

<p><sup>6</sup> He does not prolong the life of the wicked, but gives the needy <i>and</i> afflicted their right.

<p><sup>7</sup> He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous (the upright in right standing with God); but He sets them forever with kings upon the throne, and they are exalted.

<p><sup>8</sup> And if they are bound in fetters <font color='#7a8080'>[of adversity]</font> and held by cords of affliction,

<p><sup>9</sup> Then He shows to them <font color='#7a8080'>[the true character of]</font> their deeds and their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly <font color='#7a8080'>[with presumption and self-sufficiency]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> He also opens their ears to instruction <i>and</i> discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity.

<p><sup>11</sup> If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness <i>and</i> joy.

<p><sup>12</sup> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's destructive judgments]</font>, and they shall die in ignorance of true knowledge.

<p><sup>13</sup> But the godless <i>and</i> profane in heart heap up anger <font color='#7a8080'>[at the divine discipline]</font>; they do not cry to Him when He binds them <font color='#7a8080'>[with cords of affliction]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> They die in youth, and their life perishes among the unclean (those who are sodomites).

<p><sup>15</sup> He delivers the afflicted in their affliction and opens their ears <font color='#7a8080'>[to His voice]</font> in adversity.

<p><sup>16</sup> Indeed, God would have allured you out of the mouth of distress into a broad place where there is no situation of perplexity <i>or</i> privation; and that which would be set on your table would be full of fatness.

<p><sup>17</sup> But if you <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> are filled with the judgment of the wicked, judgment and justice will keep hold on you.

<p><sup>18</sup> For let not wrath entice you into scorning chastisements; and let not the greatness of the ransom <font color='#7a8080'>[the suffering, if rightly endured]</font> turn you aside.

<p><sup>19</sup> Will your cry be sufficient to keep you from distress, or will all the force of your strength do it?

<p><sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off from their places;

<p><sup>21</sup> Take heed, turn not to iniquity, for this <font color='#7a8080'>[the iniquity of complaining against God]</font> you have chosen rather than <font color='#7a8080'>[submission in]</font> affliction.

<p><sup>22</sup> Behold, God exalts <i>and</i> does loftily in His power; who is a ruler <i>or</i> a teacher like Him?

<p><sup>23</sup> Who has appointed God His way? Or who can say, You have done unrighteousness?

<p><sup>24</sup> Remember that <font color='#7a8080'>[by submission]</font> you magnify God's work, of which men have sung.

<p><sup>25</sup> All men have looked upon God's work; man may behold it afar off.

<p><sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we know Him not! The number of His years is unsearchable.

<p><sup>27</sup> For He draws up the drops of water, which distil as rain from His vapor,

<p><sup>28</sup> Which the skies pour down and drop abundantly upon <font color='#7a8080'>[the multitudes of]</font> mankind.

<p><sup>29</sup> Not only that, but can anyone understand the spreadings of the clouds <i>or</i> the thunderings of His pavilion?

<p><sup>30</sup> Behold, He spreads His lightning against the dark clouds and covers the roots of the sea.

<p><sup>31</sup> For by <font color='#7a8080'>[His clouds]</font> God executes judgment upon the peoples; He gives food in abundance.

<p><sup>32</sup> He covers His hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark.

<p><sup>33</sup> His thunderings speak <font color='#7a8080'>[awesomely]</font> concerning Him; the cattle are told of His coming storm.

<h4>37</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Indeed, <font color='#7a8080'>[at His thunderings]</font> my heart also trembles and leaps out of its place.

<p><sup>2</sup> Hear, oh, hear the roar of His voice and the sound of rumbling that goes out of His mouth!

<p><sup>3</sup> Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, and His lightning to the ends of the earth.

<p><sup>4</sup> After it His voice roars; He thunders with the voice of His majesty, and He restrains not <font color='#7a8080'>[His lightnings against His adversaries]</font> when His voice is heard.

<p><sup>5</sup> God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend.

<p><sup>6</sup> For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth; likewise He speaks to the showers and to the downpour of His mighty rains.

<p><sup>7</sup> God seals up (stops, brings to a standstill by severe weather) the hand of every man <font color='#7a8080'>[and now under His seal their hands are forced to inactivity]</font>, that all men whom He has made may know His doings (His sovereign power and their subjection to it).

<p><sup>8</sup> Then the beasts go into dens and remain in their lairs.

<p><sup>9</sup> Out of its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds.

<p><sup>10</sup> By the breath of God ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is frozen over.

<p><sup>11</sup> He loads the thick cloud with moisture; He scatters the cloud of His lightning.

<p><sup>12</sup> And it is turned round about by His guidance, that they may do whatever He commands them upon the face of the habitable earth.

<p><sup>13</sup> Whether it be for correction or for His earth <font color='#7a8080'>[generally]</font> or for His mercy <i>and</i> loving-kindness, He causes it to come.

<p><sup>14</sup> Hear this, O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.

<p><sup>15</sup> Do you know how God lays His command upon them and causes the lightning of His <font color='#7a8080'>[storm]</font> cloud to shine?

<p><sup>16</sup> Do you know how the clouds are balanced <font color='#7a8080'>[and poised in the heavens]</font>, the wonderful works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge?

<p><sup>17</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Or]</font> why your garments are hot when He quiets the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[in sultry summer]</font> with the <font color='#7a8080'>[oppressive]</font> south wind?

<p><sup>18</sup> Can you along with Him spread out the sky, <font color='#7a8080'>[which is]</font> strong as a molten mirror?

<p><sup>19</sup> Tell us <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> with what words of man we may address such a Being; we cannot state our case because we are in the dark <font color='#7a8080'>[in the presence of the unsearchable God]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> So shall it be told Him that I wish to speak? If a man speaks, shall he be swallowed up?

<p><sup>21</sup> And now men cannot look upon the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them.

<p><sup>22</sup> Golden brightness <i>and</i> splendor come out of the north; <font color='#7a8080'>[if men can scarcely look upon it, how much less upon the]</font> terrible splendor <i>and</i> majesty God has upon Himself!

<p><sup>23</sup> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find Him out; He is excellent in power; and to justice and plenteous righteousness He does no violence <font color='#7a8080'>[He will disregard no right]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> Men therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fear Him; He regards <i>and</i> respects not any who are wise in heart <font color='#7a8080'>[in their own understanding and conceit]</font>.

<h4>38</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,

<p><sup>2</sup> Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?

<p><sup>3</sup> Gird up now your loins like a man, and I will demand of you, and you declare to Me.

<p><sup>4</sup> Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Declare to Me, if you have <i>and</i> know understanding.

<p><sup>5</sup> Who determined the measures of the earth, if you know? Or who stretched the measuring line upon it?

<p><sup>6</sup> Upon what were the foundations of it fastened, or who laid its cornerstone,

<p><sup>7</sup> When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

<p><sup>8</sup> Or who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth <i>and</i> issued out of the womb?—

<p><sup>9</sup> When I made the clouds the garment of it, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,

<p><sup>10</sup> And marked for it My appointed boundary and set bars and doors,

<p><sup>11</sup> And said, Thus far shall you come and no farther; and here shall your proud waves be stayed?

<p><sup>12</sup> Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place,

<p><sup>13</sup> So that <font color='#7a8080'>[light]</font> may get hold of the corners of the earth and shake the wickedness <font color='#7a8080'>[of night]</font> out of it?

<p><sup>14</sup> It is changed like clay into which a seal is pressed; and things stand out like a many-colored garment.

<p><sup>15</sup> From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken.

<p><sup>16</sup> Have you explored the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?

<p><sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of deep darkness?

<p><sup>18</sup> Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know it all.

<p><sup>19</sup> Where is the way where light dwells? And as for darkness, where is its abode,

<p><sup>20</sup> That you may conduct it to its home, and may know the paths to its house?

<p><sup>21</sup> You must know, since you were born then! Or because you are so extremely old!

<p><sup>22</sup> Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen the treasuries of the hail,

<p><sup>23</sup> Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?

<p><sup>24</sup> By what way is the light distributed, or the east wind spread over the earth?

<p><sup>25</sup> Who has prepared a channel for the torrents of rain, or a path for the thunderbolt,

<p><sup>26</sup> To cause it to rain on the uninhabited land <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> on the desert where no man lives,

<p><sup>27</sup> To satisfy the waste <i>and</i> desolate ground and to cause the tender grass to spring forth?

<p><sup>28</sup> Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?

<p><sup>29</sup> Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who has given it birth?

<p><sup>30</sup> The waters are congealed like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.

<p><sup>31</sup> Can you bind the chains of <font color='#7a8080'>[the cluster of stars called]</font> Pleiades, or loose the cords of <font color='#7a8080'>[the constellation]</font> Orion?

<p><sup>32</sup> Can you lead forth the signs of the zodiac in their season? Or can you guide <font color='#7a8080'>[the stars of]</font> the Bear with her young?

<p><sup>33</sup> Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule upon the earth?

<p><sup>34</sup> Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an abundance of waters may cover you?

<p><sup>35</sup> Can you send lightnings, that they may go and say to you, Here we are?

<p><sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts <font color='#7a8080'>[or in the dark clouds]</font>? Or who has given understanding to the mind <font color='#7a8080'>[or to the meteor]</font>?

<p><sup>37</sup> Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the <font color='#7a8080'>[water]</font> bottles of the heavens

<p><sup>38</sup> When <font color='#7a8080'>[heat has caused]</font> the dust to run into a mass and the clods to cleave fast together?

<p><sup>39</sup> Can you <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> hunt the prey for the lion? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions

<p><sup>40</sup> When they couch in their dens or lie in wait in their hiding place?

<p><sup>41</sup> Who provides for the raven its prey when its young ones cry to God and wander about for lack of food?

<h4>39</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Do you know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth <font color='#7a8080'>[their young]</font>? <font color='#7a8080'>[Or]</font> do you observe when the hinds are giving birth? <font color='#7a8080'>[Do you attend to all this, Job?]</font>

<p><sup>2</sup> Can you number the months that they carry their offspring? Or do you know the time when they are delivered,

<p><sup>3</sup> When they bow themselves, bring forth their young ones, <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> cast out their pains?

<p><sup>4</sup> Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; they go forth and return not to them.

<p><sup>5</sup> Who has sent out the wild donkey, giving him his freedom? Or who has loosed the bands of the swift donkey <font color='#7a8080'>[by which his tame brother is bound—he, the shy, the swift-footed, and the untamable]</font>,

<p><sup>6</sup> Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place?

<p><sup>7</sup> He scorns the tumult of the city and hears not the shoutings of the taskmaster.

<p><sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.

<p><sup>9</sup> Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, or remain beside your manger?

<p><sup>10</sup> Can you bind the wild ox with a harness to the plow in the furrow? Or will he harrow the furrows for you?

<p><sup>11</sup> Will you trust him because his strength is great, or to him will you leave your labor?

<p><sup>12</sup> Will you depend upon him to bring home your seed and gather the grain of your threshing floor? <font color='#7a8080'>[Who, Job, was the author of this strange variance in the disposition of animals so alike in appearance? Was it you?]</font>

<p><sup>13</sup> The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, <font color='#7a8080'>[but]</font> are they the pinions and plumage of love?

<p><sup>14</sup> The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust,

<p><sup>15</sup> Forgetting that a foot may crush them or that the wild beast may trample them.

<p><sup>16</sup> She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labor is in vain because she has no sense of danger <font color='#7a8080'>[for her unborn brood]</font>,

<p><sup>17</sup> For God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has He imparted to her understanding.

<p><sup>18</sup> Yet when she lifts herself up in flight, <font color='#7a8080'>[so swift is she that]</font> she can laugh to scorn the horse and his rider.

<p><sup>19</sup> Have you given the horse his might? Have you clothed his neck with quivering <i>and</i> a shaking mane?

<p><sup>20</sup> Was it you <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> who made him to leap like a locust? The majesty of his <font color='#7a8080'>[snorting]</font> nostrils is terrible.

<p><sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons <font color='#7a8080'>[of armed men]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> He mocks at fear and is not dismayed <i>or</i> terrified; neither does he turn back <font color='#7a8080'>[in battle]</font> from the sword.

<p><sup>23</sup> The quiver rattles upon him, as do the glittering spear and the lance <font color='#7a8080'>[of his rider]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[He seems in running to]</font> devour the ground with fierceness and rage; neither can he stand still at the sound of the <font color='#7a8080'>[war]</font> trumpet.

<p><sup>25</sup> As often as the trumpet sounds he says, Ha, ha! And he smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

<p><sup>26</sup> Is it by your wisdom <font color='#7a8080'>[Job]</font> that the hawk soars and stretches her wings toward the south <font color='#7a8080'>[as winter approaches]</font>?

<p><sup>27</sup> Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on <font color='#7a8080'>[a]</font> high <font color='#7a8080'>[inaccessible place]</font>?

<p><sup>28</sup> On the cliff he dwells and remains securely, upon the point of the rock and the stronghold.

<p><sup>29</sup> From there he spies out the prey; and his eyes see it afar off.

<p><sup>30</sup> His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he.

<h4>40</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Moreover, the Lord said to Job,

<p><sup>2</sup> Shall he who would find fault with the Almighty contend with Him? He who disputes with God, let him answer it.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then Job replied to the Lord:

<p><sup>4</sup> Behold, I am of small account <i>and</i> vile! What shall I answer You? I lay my hand upon my mouth.

<p><sup>5</sup> I have spoken once, but I will not reply again—indeed, twice <font color='#7a8080'>[have I answered]</font>, but I will proceed no further.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, saying,

<p><sup>7</sup> Gird up your loins now like a man; I will demand of you, and you answer Me.

<p><sup>8</sup> Will you also annul (set aside and render void) My judgment? Will you condemn Me <font color='#7a8080'>[your God]</font>, that you may <font color='#7a8080'>[appear]</font> righteous <i>and</i> justified?

<p><sup>9</sup> Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?

<p><sup>10</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Since you question the manner of the Almighty's rule]</font> deck yourself now with the excellency <i>and</i> dignity <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Supreme Ruler, and yourself undertake the government of the world if you are so wise]</font>, <i>and</i> array yourself with honor and majesty.

<p><sup>11</sup> Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him;

<p><sup>12</sup> Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low, and tread down the wicked where they stand <font color='#7a8080'>[if you are so able, Job]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Bury and]</font> hide them all in the dust together; <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> shut them up <font color='#7a8080'>[in the prison house of death]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[If you can do all this, Job, proving yourself of divine might]</font> then will I <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> praise you also <font color='#7a8080'>[and acknowledge that]</font> your own right hand can save you.

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold now the behemoth (the hippopotamus), which I created as I did you; he eats grass like an ox.

<p><sup>16</sup> See now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in the sinews of his belly.

<p><sup>17</sup> He moves his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are twisted together <font color='#7a8080'>[like a rope]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs <font color='#7a8080'>[or ribs]</font> are like bars of iron.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The hippopotamus]</font> is the first <font color='#7a8080'>[in magnitude and power]</font> of the works of God <font color='#7a8080'>[in animal life]</font>; <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> He Who made him provides him with his <font color='#7a8080'>[swordlike tusks, or only God Who made him can bring near His sword to master him]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him food, where all the wild animals play.

<p><sup>21</sup> He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reeds in the marsh.

<p><sup>22</sup> The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook compass him about.

<p><sup>23</sup> Behold, if a river is violent <i>and</i> overflows, he does not tremble; he is confident, though the Jordan <font color='#7a8080'>[River]</font> swells and rushes against his mouth.

<p><sup>24</sup> Can any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?

<h4>41</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Can you draw out the leviathan (the crocodile) with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?

<p><sup>2</sup> Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook <i>or</i> a spike?

<p><sup>3</sup> Will he make many supplications to you <font color='#7a8080'>[begging to be spared]</font>? Will he speak soft words to you <font color='#7a8080'>[to coax you to treat him kindly]</font>?

<p><sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever?

<p><sup>5</sup> Will you play with <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile]</font> as with a bird? Or will you put him on a leash for your maidens?

<p><sup>6</sup> Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?

<p><sup>7</sup> Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishing spears?

<p><sup>8</sup> Lay your hand upon him! Remember your battle with him; you will not do <font color='#7a8080'>[such an ill-advised thing]</font> again!

<p><sup>9</sup> Behold, the hope of <font color='#7a8080'>[his assailant]</font> is disappointed; one is cast down even at the sight of him!

<p><sup>10</sup> No one is so fierce <font color='#7a8080'>[and foolhardy]</font> that he dares to stir up <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile]</font>; who then is he who can stand before Me <font color='#7a8080'>[the beast's Creator, or dares to contend with Me]</font>?

<p><sup>11</sup> Who has first given to Me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heavens is Mine. <font color='#7a8080'>[Therefore, who can have a claim against God, God Who made the unmastered crocodile?]</font>

<p><sup>12</sup> I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.

<p><sup>13</sup> Who can strip off <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile's]</font> outer garment? <font color='#7a8080'>[Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?]</font> Who shall come within his jaws?

<p><sup>14</sup> Who can open the doors of his <font color='#7a8080'>[lipless]</font> mouth? His <font color='#7a8080'>[extended jaws and bare]</font> teeth are terrible round about.

<p><sup>15</sup> His scales are <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile's]</font> pride, <font color='#7a8080'>[for his back is made of rows of shields]</font> shut up together <font color='#7a8080'>[as with]</font> a tight seal;

<p><sup>16</sup> One is so near to another that no air can come between them.

<p><sup>17</sup> They are joined one to another; they stick together so that they cannot be separated.

<p><sup>18</sup> His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the <font color='#7a8080'>[reddish]</font> eyelids of the dawn.

<p><sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning torches, <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> sparks of fire leap out.

<p><sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke, as out of a seething pot over a fire of rushes.

<p><sup>21</sup> His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth.

<p><sup>22</sup> In <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile's]</font> neck abides strength, and terror dances before him.

<p><sup>23</sup> The folds of his flesh cleave together; they are firm upon him, and they cannot shake <font color='#7a8080'>[when he moves]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone, indeed, as solid as a nether millstone.

<p><sup>25</sup> When <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile]</font> raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of terror <i>and</i> the crashing they are beside themselves.

<p><sup>26</sup> Even if one strikes at him with the sword, it cannot get any hold, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.

<p><sup>27</sup> He counts iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.

<p><sup>28</sup> The arrow cannot make <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile]</font> flee; slingstones are treated by him as stubble.

<p><sup>29</sup> Clubs <font color='#7a8080'>[also]</font> are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rushing <i>and</i> the rattling of the javelin.

<p><sup>30</sup> His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery; he spreads <font color='#7a8080'>[grooves like]</font> a threshing sledge upon the mire.

<p><sup>31</sup> He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a <font color='#7a8080'>[foaming]</font> pot of ointment.

<p><sup>32</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[His swift darting]</font> makes a shining track behind him; one would think the deep to be hoary <font color='#7a8080'>[with foam]</font>.

<p><sup>33</sup> Upon earth there is not <font color='#7a8080'>[the crocodile's]</font> equal, a creature made without fear <i>and</i> he behaves fearlessly.

<p><sup>34</sup> He looks all mighty <font color='#7a8080'>[beasts of prey]</font> in the face <font color='#7a8080'>[without terror]</font>; he is monarch over all the sons of pride. <font color='#7a8080'>[And now, Job, who are you who dares not arouse the unmastered crocodile, yet who dares resist Me, the beast's Creator, to My face? Everything under the heavens is Mine; therefore, who can have a claim against God?]</font>

<h4>42</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Job said to the Lord,

<p><sup>2</sup> I know that You can do all things, and that no thought <i>or</i> purpose of Yours can be restrained <i>or</i> thwarted.

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[You said to me]</font> Who is this that darkens <i>and</i> obscures counsel <font color='#7a8080'>[by words]</font> without knowledge? Therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[I now see]</font> I have <font color='#7a8080'>[rashly]</font> uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[I had virtually said to You what You have said to me:]</font> Hear, I beseech You, and I will speak; I will demand of You, and You declare to me.

<p><sup>5</sup> I had heard of You <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> by the hearing of the ear, but now my <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> eye sees You.

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore I loathe <font color='#7a8080'>[my words]</font> <i>and</i> abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes.

<p><sup>7</sup> After the Lord had spoken the previous words to Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has.

<p><sup>8</sup> Now therefore take seven bullocks and seven rams and go to My servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept <font color='#7a8080'>[his prayer]</font> that I deal not with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has.

<p><sup>9</sup> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them; and the Lord accepted <font color='#7a8080'>[Job's prayer]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> And the Lord turned the captivity of Job <i>and</i> restored his fortunes, when he prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they sympathized with him and comforted him over all the <font color='#7a8080'>[distressing]</font> calamities that the Lord had brought upon him. Every man also gave him a piece of money, and every man an earring of gold.

<p><sup>12</sup> And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.

<p><sup>13</sup> He had also seven sons and three daughters.

<p><sup>14</sup> And he called the name of the first Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.

<p><sup>15</sup> And in all the land there were no women so fair as the daughters of Job, and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.

<p><sup>16</sup> After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his sons' sons, even to four generations.

<p><sup>17</sup> So Job died, an old man and full of days.
