<h4>1</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin <font color='#7a8080'>[two or three miles north of Jerusalem]</font>,
<p><sup>2</sup> To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah in the thirteenth year of his reign.

<p><sup>3</sup> It came also in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem into captivity in the fifth month.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then the word of the Lord came to me <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font>, saying,

<p><sup>5</sup> Before I formed you in the womb I knew <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> approved of you <font color='#7a8080'>[as My chosen instrument]</font>, and before you were born I separated <i>and</i> set you apart, consecrating you; <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then said I, Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am only a youth.

<p><sup>7</sup> But the Lord said to me, Say not, I am only a youth; for you shall go to all to whom I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.

<p><sup>8</sup> Be not afraid of them <font color='#7a8080'>[their faces]</font>, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.

<p><sup>9</sup> Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.

<p><sup>10</sup> See, I have this day appointed you to the oversight of the nations and of the kingdoms to root out and pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.

<p><sup>11</sup> Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a branch <i>or</i> shoot of an almond tree <font color='#7a8080'>[the emblem of alertness and activity, blossoming in late winter]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> Then said the Lord to me, You have seen well, for I am alert <i>and</i> active, watching over My word to perform it.

<p><sup>13</sup> And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot, and the face of it is <font color='#7a8080'>[tipped away]</font> from the north <font color='#7a8080'>[its mouth about to pour forth on the south, on Judea]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> Then the Lord said to me, Out of the north the evil <font color='#7a8080'>[which the prophets had foretold as the result of national sin]</font> shall disclose itself <i>and</i> break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.

<p><sup>15</sup> For, behold, I will call all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, says the Lord; and they will come and set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[as God's judicial act, a consequence of Judah's wickedness]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> And I will utter My judgments against them for all the wickedness of those who have forsaken Me, burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands <font color='#7a8080'>[idols]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> But you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font>, gird up your loins! Arise and tell them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed <i>and</i> break down at the sight of their faces, lest I confound you before them <i>and</i> permit you to be overcome.

<p><sup>18</sup> For I, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city and an iron pillar and bronze walls against the whole land—against the <font color='#7a8080'>[successive]</font> kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land <font color='#7a8080'>[giving you divine strength which no hostile power can overcome]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> And they shall fight against you, but they shall not <font color='#7a8080'>[finally]</font> prevail against you, for I am with you, says the Lord, to deliver you.

<h4>2</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And the word of the Lord came to me <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font>, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says the Lord: I <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember the kindness <i>and</i> devotion of your youth, your love after your betrothal <font color='#7a8080'>[in Egypt]</font> <i>and</i> marriage <font color='#7a8080'>[at Sinai]</font> when you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.

<p><sup>3</sup> Israel was holiness <font color='#7a8080'>[something set apart from ordinary purposes, dedicated]</font> to the Lord, the firstfruits of His harvest <font color='#7a8080'>[of which no stranger was allowed to partake]</font>; all who ate of it <font color='#7a8080'>[injuring Israel]</font> offended <i>and</i> became guilty; evil came upon them, says the Lord.

<p><sup>4</sup> Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.

<p><sup>5</sup> Thus says the Lord: What unrighteousness did your fathers find in Me, that they went far from Me and <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> went after emptiness, falseness, <i>and</i> futility and themselves became fruitless <i>and</i> worthless?

<p><sup>6</sup> Nor did they say, Where is the Lord, Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death <i>and</i> deep darkness, through a land that no man passes through and where no man dwells?

<p><sup>7</sup> And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and good things. But when you entered, you defiled My land and made My heritage an abomination <font color='#7a8080'>[detestable and loathsome]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Even]</font> the priests did not say, Where is the Lord? And those who handle the law <font color='#7a8080'>[given by God to Moses]</font> knew Me not. The rulers <i>and</i> secular shepherds also transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by <font color='#7a8080'>[the authority and in the name of]</font> Baal and followed after things that do not profit.

<p><sup>9</sup> Therefore I will still contend with you <font color='#7a8080'>[by inflicting further judgments on you]</font>, says the Lord, and with your children's children will I contend.

<p><sup>10</sup> For cross over to the coasts of Cyprus <font color='#7a8080'>[to the west]</font> and see, send also to Kedar <font color='#7a8080'>[to the east]</font> and carefully consider; and see whether there has been such a thing as this:

<p><sup>11</sup> Has a nation <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> changed its gods, even though they are not gods? But My people have changed their Glory <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> for that which does not profit.

<p><sup>12</sup> Be astonished <i>and</i> appalled, O heavens, at this; be shocked <i>and</i> shrivel up with horror, says the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[at the behavior of the people]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> For My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of living waters, <i>and</i> they have hewn for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns which cannot hold water.

<p><sup>14</sup> Is Israel a servant? Is he a homeborn slave? Why has he become a captive <i>and</i> a prey?

<p><sup>15</sup> The young lions have roared over him <i>and</i> made their voices heard. And they have made his land a waste; his cities are burned ruins without inhabitant.

<p><sup>16</sup> Moreover, the children of Memphis and Tahpanhes (Egypt) <font color='#7a8080'>[have in times past shown their power as a foe; they]</font> have broken <i>and</i> fed on the crown of your head <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>—so do not rely on them as an ally now.

<p><sup>17</sup> Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the Lord your God when He led you in the way?

<p><sup>18</sup> And now what have you to gain by allying yourself with Egypt <i>and</i> going her way, to drink the <font color='#7a8080'>[black and roiled]</font> waters of the Nile? Or what have you to gain in going the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphrates?

<p><sup>19</sup> Your own wickedness shall chasten <i>and</i> correct you, and your backslidings <i>and</i> desertion of faith shall reprove you. Know therefore <i>and</i> recognize that this is an evil and bitter thing: <font color='#7a8080'>[first,]</font> you have forsaken the Lord your God; <font color='#7a8080'>[second,]</font> you are indifferent to Me <i>and</i> the fear of Me is not in you, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>20</sup> For long ago <font color='#7a8080'>[in Egypt]</font> I broke your yoke and burst your bonds <font color='#7a8080'>[not that you might be free, but that you might serve Me]</font> <i>and</i> long ago you shattered the yoke and snapped the bonds <font color='#7a8080'>[of My law which I put upon you]</font>; you said, I will not serve <i>and</i> obey You! For upon every high hill and under every green tree you <font color='#7a8080'>[eagerly]</font> prostrated yourself <font color='#7a8080'>[in idolatrous worship]</font>, playing the harlot.

<p><sup>21</sup> Yet I had planted you <font color='#7a8080'>[O house of Israel]</font> a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned into degenerate shoots of wild vine alien to Me?

<p><sup>22</sup> For though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, yet your iniquity <i>and</i> guilt are still <font color='#7a8080'>[upon you; you are]</font> spotted, dirty, <i>and</i> stained before Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>23</sup> How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals <font color='#7a8080'>[other gods]</font>? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done. You are a restive young female camel <font color='#7a8080'>[in the uncontrollable violence of her brute passion eagerly]</font> running hither and thither,

<p><sup>24</sup> Or <font color='#7a8080'>[you have the untamed and reckless nature of]</font> a wild donkey used to the desert, in her heat sniffing the wind <font color='#7a8080'>[for the scent of a male]</font>. In her mating season who can restrain her? No males seeking her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her <font color='#7a8080'>[seeking them]</font>.

<p><sup>25</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Cease from your mad running after idols, from which you get nothing but bitter injury.]</font> Keep your feet from being unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, It is hopeless! For I have loved strangers <i>and</i> foreigners, and after them I will go.

<p><sup>26</sup> As the thief is brought to shame when he is caught, so shall the house of Israel be brought to shame—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets—

<p><sup>27</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Inasmuch as]</font> they say to a tree, You are my father, and to a stone, You gave me birth. For they have turned their backs to Me and not their faces; but in the time of their trouble, they say, Arise <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> and save us!

<p><sup>28</sup> But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble! For <font color='#7a8080'>[as many as]</font> the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah. <font color='#7a8080'>[Surely so many handmade idols should be able to help you!]</font>

<p><sup>29</sup> Why do you complain <i>and</i> remonstrate against My wrath? You all have rebelled <i>and</i> revolted against Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>30</sup> In vain have I stricken your children (your people); they received no discipline (no correction). Your own sword devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.

<p><sup>31</sup> O generation <font color='#7a8080'>[that you are]</font>! Behold, consider, <i>and</i> regard the word of the Lord: Have I been a wilderness to Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[like a land without food]</font>? A land of deep darkness <font color='#7a8080'>[like a way without light]</font>? Why do My people say, We have broken loose <font color='#7a8080'>[we are free and will roam at large]</font>; we will come no more to You?

<p><sup>32</sup> Can a maid forget <i>and</i> neglect <font color='#7a8080'>[to wear]</font> her ornaments, or a bride her <font color='#7a8080'>[marriage]</font> girdle <font color='#7a8080'>[with its significance like that of a wedding ring]</font>? Yet My people have forgotten Me, days without number.

<p><sup>33</sup> How you deck yourself <i>and</i> direct your way to procure <font color='#7a8080'>[adulterous]</font> love! Because of it even wicked women have learned <font color='#7a8080'>[indecent]</font> ways from you.

<p><sup>34</sup> Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of the persons of the innocent poor; you did not find them housebreaking, <i>nor</i> have I found it out by secret search. But it is because of <font color='#7a8080'>[your lust for idolatry that you have done]</font> all these things—<font color='#7a8080'>[that is everywhere evident.]</font>

<p><sup>35</sup> Yet you keep saying, I am innocent; surely His anger has turned away from Me. Behold, I will bring you to judgment <i>and</i> will plead against you because you say, I have not sinned.

<p><sup>36</sup> Why do you gad <i>or</i> wander about so much to change your way? You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.

<p><sup>37</sup> From <font color='#7a8080'>[Egypt]</font> also you will come away with your hands upon your head, for the Lord has rejected those in whom you confide, and you will not prosper with <font color='#7a8080'>[respect to]</font> them.

<h4>3</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> That is to say, If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's, will he return to her again? <font color='#7a8080'>[Of course not!]</font> Would not that land <font color='#7a8080'>[where such a thing happened]</font> be greatly polluted? But you have played the harlot <font color='#7a8080'>[against Me]</font> with many lovers—yet would you now return to Me? says the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[or do you even think to return to Me?]</font>

<p><sup>2</sup> Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see. Where have you not been adulterously lain with? By the wayside you have sat waiting for lovers <font color='#7a8080'>[eager for idolatry]</font>, like an Arabian <font color='#7a8080'>[desert tribesman who waits to plunder]</font> in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your vile harlotry and your wickedness (unfaithfulness and disobedience to God).

<p><sup>3</sup> Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no spring rain. Yet you have the brow of a prostitute; you refuse to be ashamed.

<p><sup>4</sup> Have you not just now cried to Me: My Father, You were the guide <i>and</i> companion of my youth?

<p><sup>5</sup> Will He retain His anger forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold, you have so spoken, but you have done all the evil things you could <i>and</i> have had your way <i>and</i> have carried them through.

<p><sup>6</sup> Moreover, the Lord said to me <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> in the days of Josiah the king <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font>, Have you seen what that faithless <i>and</i> backsliding Israel has done—how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree and there played the harlot?

<p><sup>7</sup> And I said, After she has done all these things, she will return to Me; but she did not return, and her faithless <i>and</i> treacherous sister Judah saw it.

<p><sup>8</sup> And I saw, even though <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah knew]</font> that for this very cause of committing adultery (idolatry) I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> had put faithless Israel away and given her a bill of divorce; yet her faithless <i>and</i> treacherous sister Judah was not afraid, but she also went and played the harlot <font color='#7a8080'>[following after idols]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> And through the infamy <i>and</i> unseemly frivolity of Israel's whoredom <font color='#7a8080'>[because her immorality mattered little to her]</font>, she polluted <i>and</i> defiled the land, <font color='#7a8080'>[by her idolatry]</font> committing adultery with <font color='#7a8080'>[idols of]</font> stones and trees.

<p><sup>10</sup> But in spite of all this, her faithless <i>and</i> treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me in sincerity <i>and</i> with her whole heart, but only in sheer hypocrisy <font color='#7a8080'>[has she feigned obedience to King Josiah's reforms]</font>, says the Lord.

<p><sup>11</sup> And the Lord said to me, Backsliding <i>and</i> faithless Israel has shown herself less guilty than false <i>and</i> treacherous Judah.

<p><sup>12</sup> Go and proclaim these words toward the north <font color='#7a8080'>[where the ten tribes have been taken as captives]</font> and say, Return, faithless Israel, says the Lord, <i>and</i> I will not cause My countenance to fall <i>and</i> look in anger upon you, for I am merciful, says the Lord; I will not keep My anger forever.

<p><sup>13</sup> Only know, understand, <i>and</i> acknowledge your iniquity <i>and</i> guilt—that you have rebelled <i>and</i> transgressed against the Lord your God and have scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says the Lord.

<p><sup>14</sup> Return, O faithless children <font color='#7a8080'>[of the whole twelve tribes]</font>, says the Lord, for I am Lord <i>and</i> Master <i>and</i> Husband to you, and I will take you <font color='#7a8080'>[not as a nation, but individually]</font>—one from a city and two from a tribal family—and I will bring you to Zion.

<p><sup>15</sup> And I will give you <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> shepherds after My own heart <font color='#7a8080'>[in the final time]</font>, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding <i>and</i> judgment.

<p><sup>16</sup> And it shall be that when you have multiplied and increased in the land in those days, says the Lord, they shall no more say, The ark of the covenant of the Lord. It shall not come to mind, nor shall they <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember it, nor shall they miss <i>or</i> visit it, nor shall it be repaired <i>or</i> made again <font color='#7a8080'>[for instead of the ark, which represented God's presence, He will show Himself to be present throughout the city]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> At that time they shall call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord, and all the nations shall be gathered to it, in the renown <i>and</i> name of the Lord, to Jerusalem; nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their own evil hearts.

<p><sup>18</sup> In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and together they shall come out of the land of the north to the land that I gave as an inheritance to your fathers.

<p><sup>19</sup> And I thought how <font color='#7a8080'>[gloriously and honorably]</font> I would set you among My children and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage, the most beautiful <i>and</i> best <font color='#7a8080'>[inheritance]</font> among all nations! And I thought you would call Me My Father and would not turn away from following Me.

<p><sup>20</sup> Surely, as a wife treacherously <i>and</i> faithlessly departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously <i>and</i> faithlessly with Me, O house of Israel, says the Lord.

<p><sup>21</sup> A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping <i>and</i> pleading of the sons of Israel, because they have perverted their ways, they have <font color='#7a8080'>[eagerly]</font> forgotten the Lord their God.

<p><sup>22</sup> Return, O faithless sons, <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord, and]</font> I will heal your faithlessness. <font color='#7a8080'>[And they answer]</font> Behold, we come to You, for You are the Lord our God.

<p><sup>23</sup> Truly in vain is the hope of salvation from the hills and from the tumult <i>and</i> noisy throng on the mountains; truly in <i>and</i> with the Lord our God rests the salvation of Israel.

<p><sup>24</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[We have been ruined as a nation by our faithlessness and idolatry]</font> for the shameful thing has consumed all for which our fathers toiled from our youth—their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

<p><sup>25</sup> Let us lie prostrate in our shame, and let our dishonor <i>and</i> confusion cover us; for we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers; from our youth even to this day we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.

<h4>4</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> If you will return, O Israel, says the Lord, if you will return to Me, and if you will put away your abominable false gods out of My sight and not stray <i>or</i> waver,

<p><sup>2</sup> And if you swear, As the Lord lives, in truth, in judgment <i>and</i> justice, and in righteousness (uprightness in every area and relation), then the nations will bless themselves in Him and in Him will they glory.

<p><sup>3</sup> For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Break up your ground left uncultivated for a season, so that you may not sow among thorns.

<p><sup>4</sup> Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest My wrath go forth like fire <font color='#7a8080'>[consuming all that gets in its way]</font> and burn so that no one can quench it because of the evil of your doings.

<p><sup>5</sup> Declare in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say: Blow the trumpet in the land; cry aloud and say: Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.

<p><sup>6</sup> Raise a standard toward Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[to mark out the safest route to those seeking safety within Jerusalem's walls]</font>! Flee for safety, stay not, for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.

<p><sup>7</sup> A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations is on his way. He has gone forth from his place to make your land a desolate waste; and your cities shall be left in ruins without an inhabitant.

<p><sup>8</sup> For this, gird yourselves with sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned back from us.

<p><sup>9</sup> And it shall be in that day, says the Lord, that the understanding <i>and</i> courage of the king shall fail (be paralyzed), and also that of the princes; the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded <i>and</i> dazed with horror.

<p><sup>10</sup> Then I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> said, Alas, Lord God! Surely You have greatly deceived <i>and</i> misled this people and Jerusalem, <font color='#7a8080'>[for the prophets represented You as]</font> saying <font color='#7a8080'>[to Your people]</font>, You shall have peace, whereas the sword has reached to <font color='#7a8080'>[their very]</font> life.

<p><sup>11</sup> At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness <font color='#7a8080'>[comes at My command]</font> against the daughter of My people—not <font color='#7a8080'>[a wind]</font> to fan or cleanse <font color='#7a8080'>[from chaff, as when threshing, but]</font>

<p><sup>12</sup> A wind too strong <i>and</i> full for winnowing comes at My word. Now I will also speak in judgment against <font color='#7a8080'>[My people]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[the enemy]</font> comes up like clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined (destroyed)!

<p><sup>14</sup> O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved! How long shall your iniquitous <i>and</i> grossly offensive thoughts lodge within you?

<p><sup>15</sup> For a voice declares from Dan <font color='#7a8080'>[in the north]</font> and proclaims evil from Mount Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[the range dividing Israel from Judah]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> Warn the <font color='#7a8080'>[neighboring]</font> nations <font color='#7a8080'>[that our adversary is coming]</font>; announce to Jerusalem that besiegers are coming from a far country, and they shout against the cities of Judah.

<p><sup>17</sup> Like keepers of a field they are against her round about, because she has been rebellious against Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>18</sup> Your ways and your doings have brought these things upon you. This is your calamity <i>and</i> doom; surely it is bitter, for surely it reaches your very heart!

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[It is not only the prophet but also the people who cry out in their thoughts]</font> My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the walls of my heart! My heart is disquieted <i>and</i> throbs aloud within me; I cannot be silent! For I have heard the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

<p><sup>20</sup> News of one violent disaster <i>and</i> calamity comes close after another, for the whole land is laid waste; suddenly are my tents spoiled <i>and</i> destroyed, and my <font color='#7a8080'>[tent]</font> curtains ruined in a moment.

<p><sup>21</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> how long must I see the flag <font color='#7a8080'>[marking the route for flight]</font> and hear the sound of the trumpet <font color='#7a8080'>[urging the people to flee for refuge]</font>?

<p><sup>22</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Their chastisement will continue until it has accomplished its purpose]</font> for My people are stupid, says the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[replying to Jeremiah]</font>; they do not know <i>and</i> understand Me. They are thickheaded children, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[and know not how]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[In a vision Jeremiah sees Judah laid waste by conquest and captivity.]</font> I looked at the land, and behold, it was <font color='#7a8080'>[as at the time of creation]</font> waste and vacant (void); and at the heavens, and they had no light.

<p><sup>24</sup> I looked at the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly to and fro.

<p><sup>25</sup> I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the air had fled.

<p><sup>26</sup> I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid waste before the Lord's presence, before His fierce anger.

<p><sup>27</sup> For thus says the Lord: The whole land will be a desolation, yet I will not make a full <i>and</i> complete end of it.

<p><sup>28</sup> For this will the earth mourn and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I will not relent, nor will I turn back <font color='#7a8080'>[from it]</font>.

<p><sup>29</sup> Every city flees because of the noise of the horsemen and bowmen. They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks; every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells in them.

<p><sup>30</sup> And you <font color='#7a8080'>[plundered one]</font>, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you paint your eyelids <i>and</i> make them look farther apart, in vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers (allies) despise you; they seek your life.

<p><sup>31</sup> For I have heard a cry as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of one who brings forth her first child—the cry of the Daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! I am fainting before the murderers.

<h4>5</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and take notice! Seek in her broad squares to see if you can find a man <font color='#7a8080'>[as Abraham sought in Sodom]</font>, one who does justice, who seeks truth, sincerity, <i>and</i> faithfulness; and I will pardon <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem—for one uncompromisingly righteous person]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> And though they say, As the Lord lives, surely they swear falsely.

<p><sup>3</sup> O Lord, do not your eyes look on the truth? <font color='#7a8080'>[They have meant to please You outwardly, but You look on their hearts.]</font> You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have consumed them, but they have refused to take correction <i>or</i> instruction. They have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refused to repent <i>and</i> return to You.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then I said, Surely these are only the poor; they are <font color='#7a8080'>[sinfully]</font> foolish <i>and</i> have no understanding, for they know not the way of the Lord, the judgment (the just and righteous law) of their God.

<p><sup>5</sup> I will go to the great men and will speak to them, for they must know the way of the Lord, the judgment (the just and righteous law) of their God. But <font color='#7a8080'>[I found the very reverse to be true]</font> these had all alike broken the yoke <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's law]</font> and had burst the bonds <font color='#7a8080'>[of obedience to Him]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the desert shall destroy them, a leopard <i>or</i> panther shall lie in wait against their cities. Everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, their backslidings <i>and</i> total desertion of faith are increased <i>and</i> have become great <i>and</i> mighty.

<p><sup>7</sup> Why should I <i>and</i> how can I pass over this <i>and</i> forgive you for it? Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by those that are no gods. When I had fed them to the full <i>and</i> bound them to Me by oath, they committed <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> adultery, assembling themselves in troops at the houses of <font color='#7a8080'>[idol]</font> harlots.

<p><sup>8</sup> They were like fed stallions roaming at large; each one neighed after his neighbor's wife.

<p><sup>9</sup> Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord; and shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?

<p><sup>10</sup> Go up within <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem's]</font> walls and destroy <font color='#7a8080'>[her vines]</font>, but do not make a full <i>and</i> complete end. Trim away the tendrils <font color='#7a8080'>[of her vines]</font>, for they are not the Lord's.

<p><sup>11</sup> For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very faithlessly <i>and</i> treacherously against Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>12</sup> They have lied about <i>and</i> denied the Lord by saying, It is not He <font color='#7a8080'>[Who speaks through His prophets]</font>! Evil shall not come upon us; nor shall we see war or famine.

<p><sup>13</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[say they]</font> the prophets will become wind <font color='#7a8080'>[what they prophesy will not come to pass]</font>, and the word <font color='#7a8080'>[of God]</font> is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them <font color='#7a8080'>[as they threatened would be done to us]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: Because you <font color='#7a8080'>[the people]</font> have spoken this word, behold, I will make My words fire in your mouth <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> and this people wood, and it will devour them.

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold, I am bringing a nation upon you from afar, O house of Israel, says the Lord. It is a mighty <i>and</i> enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.

<p><sup>16</sup> Their quiver is <font color='#7a8080'>[filled with deadly missiles]</font> like an open sepulcher <font color='#7a8080'>[filled with dead bodies; the foes]</font> are all mighty men (heroes).

<p><sup>17</sup> They shall consume your harvest and your food; they shall consume your sons and your daughters; they shall consume your flocks and your herds; they shall consume your vines and your fig trees. They shall break down <i>and</i> impoverish your fortified cities in which you trust, with the sword <font color='#7a8080'>[they shall destroy them]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> But even in those days, says the Lord, I will not make a full <i>and</i> complete end of you.

<p><sup>19</sup> And when your people say, Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us? then you shall answer them, As you have forsaken Me, says the Lord, and have served strange gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers (gods) in a land that is not yours.

<p><sup>20</sup> Declare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah:

<p><sup>21</sup> Hear now this, O foolish people without understanding <i>or</i> heart, who have eyes and see not, who have ears and hear not:

<p><sup>22</sup> Do you not fear <i>and</i> reverence Me? says the Lord. Do you not tremble before Me? <i>I</i> placed the sand for the boundary of the sea, a perpetual barrier beyond which it cannot pass <i>and</i> by an everlasting ordinance beyond which it cannot go? And though the waves of the sea toss <i>and</i> shake themselves, yet they cannot prevail <font color='#7a8080'>[against the feeble grains of sand which God has ordained by nature to be sufficient for His purpose]</font>; though <font color='#7a8080'>[the billows]</font> roar, yet they cannot pass over that <font color='#7a8080'>[barrier]</font>. <font color='#7a8080'>[Is not such a God to be reverently feared and worshiped?]</font>

<p><sup>23</sup> But these people have hearts that draw back from God and wills that rebel against Him; they have revolted <i>and</i> quit His service and have gone away <font color='#7a8080'>[into idolatry]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> Nor do they say in their hearts, Let us now reverently fear <i>and</i> worship the Lord our God, Who gives rain, both the autumn and the spring rain in its season, Who reserves <i>and</i> keeps for us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

<p><sup>25</sup> Your iniquities have turned these blessings away, and your sins have kept good <font color='#7a8080'>[harvests]</font> from you.

<p><sup>26</sup> For among My people are found wicked men; they watch like fowlers who lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.

<p><sup>27</sup> As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit <i>and</i> treachery; therefore they have become great and grown rich,

<p><sup>28</sup> They have grown fat <i>and</i> sleek. Yes, they surpass in deeds of wickedness; they do not judge <i>and</i> plead with justice the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper, and they do not defend the rights of the needy.

<p><sup>29</sup> Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord. Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?

<p><sup>30</sup> An appalling and horrible thing <font color='#7a8080'>[bringing desolation and destruction]</font> has come to pass in the land:

<p><sup>31</sup> The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests exercise rule at their own hands <i>and</i> by means of the prophets. And My people love to have it so! But what will you do when the end comes?

<h4>6</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem! And blow the trumpet in Tekoa <font color='#7a8080'>[a town far south in Judah]</font>, and raise a <font color='#7a8080'>[fire]</font> signal over Beth-haccherem <font color='#7a8080'>[a town near Jerusalem]</font>! For evil is looking forth with eagerness from the north, and great destruction.

<p><sup>2</sup> The comely and delicate one, <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> the Daughter of Zion, I will destroy. <font color='#7a8080'>[To a pasturage, yes, a luxurious pasturage, have I likened her.]</font>

<p><sup>3</sup> Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her; they shall pitch their tents round about her; they shall pasture, each one in his place <font color='#7a8080'>[eating up all her luxurious herbage on every side]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> Prepare yourselves for war against her <font color='#7a8080'>[they cry]</font>; up, let us attack her at noon! But alas, the day declines, the evening shadows lengthen.

<p><sup>5</sup> Arise, let us go by night and destroy her palaces!

<p><sup>6</sup> For the Lord of hosts has said, Hew down her trees and cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. This is the city which must be punished; there is nothing but oppression within her.

<p><sup>7</sup> As a fountain wells up <i>and</i> casts forth its waters <i>and</i> keeps them fresh, so she is <font color='#7a8080'>[continually]</font> casting forth <font color='#7a8080'>[fresh]</font> wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard within her; sickness and wounds are continually before Me.

<p><sup>8</sup> Be corrected, reformed, instructed, <i>and</i> warned, O Jerusalem, lest I be alienated <i>and</i> parted from you, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.

<p><sup>9</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean as a vine what is left of Israel; turn back your hand again <i>and</i> again <font color='#7a8080'>[O minister of destruction]</font> into the baskets, like a grape gatherer, <i>and</i> strip the tendrils <font color='#7a8080'>[of the vine]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> To whom shall I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised <font color='#7a8080'>[never brought into covenant with God or consecrated to His service]</font>, and they cannot hear <i>or</i> obey. Behold, the word of the Lord has become to them a reproach <i>and</i> the object of their scorn; they have no delight in it.

<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore I am full of the wrath of the Lord; I am weary of restraining it. I will pour it out on the children in the street and on the gathering of young men together; for even the husband with the wife will be taken, the aged with the very old.

<p><sup>12</sup> And their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord.

<p><sup>13</sup> For from the least of them even to the greatest of them, everyone is given to covetousness (to greed for unjust gain); and from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.

<p><sup>14</sup> They have healed also the wound of the daughter of My people lightly <i>and</i> neglectfully, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.

<p><sup>15</sup> Were they brought to shame because they had committed abominations (extremely disgusting and vile things)? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush <font color='#7a8080'>[at their idolatry]</font>. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them they shall be overthrown, says the Lord.

<p><sup>16</sup> Thus says the Lord: Stand by the roads and look; and ask for the eternal paths, where the good, old way is; then walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in it!

<p><sup>17</sup> Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hear <i>and</i> obey the sound of the trumpet! But they said, We will not listen <i>or</i> obey.

<p><sup>18</sup> Therefore hear, O <font color='#7a8080'>[Gentile]</font> nations, and know, O congregation <font color='#7a8080'>[of believing ones]</font>, what <font color='#7a8080'>[great things I will do]</font> to them.

<p><sup>19</sup> Hear, O earth: behold, I am bringing evil upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts (their schemes and devices) because they have not listened <i>and</i> obeyed My words, and as for My law, they have rejected it.

<p><sup>20</sup> To what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba <font color='#7a8080'>[in southwestern Arabia]</font> and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices sweet <i>or</i> pleasing to Me.

<p><sup>21</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. And the fathers and the sons together will stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend will perish.

<p><sup>22</sup> Thus says the Lord: Behold, a people is coming from the north country, and a great nation is arousing itself from the ends of the earth.

<p><sup>23</sup> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel (ruthless and inhuman) and have no mercy. Their voice sounds like the roaring sea; they ride on horses, every one set in array as a man for battle against you, O Daughter of Zion!

<p><sup>24</sup> We have heard the report of it; our hands become feeble <i>and</i> helpless. Anguish has taken hold of us, pangs like that of a woman in childbirth.

<p><sup>25</sup> Go not out into the field nor walk on the road, for the enemy is armed with the sword; terror is on every side.

<p><sup>26</sup> O daughter of my people <font color='#7a8080'>[says Jeremiah]</font>, gird yourself with sackcloth and wallow in ashes; make mourning as for an only son, a most bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come upon us <font color='#7a8080'>[on prophet and people]</font>.

<p><sup>27</sup> I <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font> have set you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> as an assayer <i>and</i> a prover of ore among My people, that you may know and try their doings and be like a watchtower.

<p><sup>28</sup> They are all the worst <font color='#7a8080'>[kind]</font> of rebels <i>and</i> utter and total revolters against God, going about publishing slander. They are <font color='#7a8080'>[not gold and silver ore, but]</font> bronze and iron; they are all corrupters.

<p><sup>29</sup> The bellows blow fiercely, the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain do they continue refining, for the wicked <font color='#7a8080'>[the dross]</font> are not removed.

<p><sup>30</sup> Men will call them reprobate <i>and</i> rejected silver <font color='#7a8080'>[only dross, without good metal]</font>, because the Lord has rejected them.

<h4>7</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Stand in the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who enter in at these gates to worship the Lord.

<p><sup>3</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

<p><sup>4</sup> Trust not in the lying words <font color='#7a8080'>[of the false prophets who maintain that God will protect Jerusalem because His temple is there]</font>, saying, This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.

<p><sup>5</sup> For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly <i>and</i> truly execute justice between every man and his neighbor,

<p><sup>6</sup> If you do not oppress the transient <i>and</i> the alien, the fatherless, and the widow or shed innocent blood <font color='#7a8080'>[by oppression and by judicial murders]</font> in <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> or go after other gods to your own hurt,

<p><sup>7</sup> Then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers to dwell in forever.

<p><sup>8</sup> Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot benefit <font color='#7a8080'>[so that you do not profit]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,

<p><sup>10</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[then dare to]</font> come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My Name, and say, <font color='#7a8080'>[By the discharge of this religious formality]</font> we are set free!—only to go on with this wickedness <i>and</i> these abominations?

<p><sup>11</sup> Has this house, which is called by My Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes <font color='#7a8080'>[a place of retreat for you between acts of violence]</font>? Behold, I Myself have seen it, says the Lord.

<p><sup>12</sup> But go now to My place which was in Shiloh <font color='#7a8080'>[in Ephraim]</font>, where I set My Name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My people Israel.

<p><sup>13</sup> And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord, and <font color='#7a8080'>[because]</font> when I spoke to you persistently <font color='#7a8080'>[even rising up early and speaking]</font>, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore will I do to this house (the temple), which is called by My Name <i>and</i> in which you trust, to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.

<p><sup>15</sup> And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole posterity of Ephraim.

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore do not pray for this people <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> or lift up a cry or entreaty for them or make intercession to Me, for I will not listen to <i>or</i> hear you.

<p><sup>17</sup> Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

<p><sup>18</sup> The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger!

<p><sup>19</sup> Am I the One Whom they provoke to anger? says the Lord. Is it not themselves <font color='#7a8080'>[whom they provoke]</font>, to their own confusion <i>and</i> vexation <i>and</i> to their own shame?

<p><sup>20</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched.

<p><sup>21</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[if you will. It will avail you nothing]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.

<p><sup>23</sup> But this thing I did command them: Listen to <i>and</i> obey My voice, and I will be your God and you will be My people; and walk in the whole way that I command you, that it may be well with you.

<p><sup>24</sup> But they would not listen to <i>and</i> obey Me or bend their ear <font color='#7a8080'>[to Me]</font>, but followed the counsels <i>and</i> the stubborn promptings of their own evil hearts <i>and</i> minds, and they turned their backs <i>and</i> went in reverse instead of forward.

<p><sup>25</sup> Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily, early and late.

<p><sup>26</sup> Yet the people would not listen to <i>and</i> obey Me or bend their ears <font color='#7a8080'>[to Me]</font>, but stiffened their necks and behaved worse than their fathers.

<p><sup>27</sup> Speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to <i>and</i> obey you; also call to them, but they will not answer you.

<p><sup>28</sup> Yet you shall say to them, This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the Lord their God or receive instruction <i>and</i> correction <i>and</i> warning; truth <i>and</i> faithfulness have perished and have completely vanished from their mouths.

<p><sup>29</sup> Cut off your hair <font color='#7a8080'>[your crown, O Jerusalem]</font> and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights, for the Lord has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.

<p><sup>30</sup> For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight, says the Lord; they have set their abominations (extremely disgusting and shamefully vile things) in the house which is called by My Name to defile it.

<p><sup>31</sup> And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom <font color='#7a8080'>[son of Hinnom]</font>, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire <font color='#7a8080'>[in honor of Molech, the fire god]</font>—which I did not command, nor did it come into My mind <i>or</i> heart.

<p><sup>32</sup> Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when it shall no more be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom <font color='#7a8080'>[son of Hinnom]</font>, but the Valley of Slaughter, for <font color='#7a8080'>[in bloody warfare]</font> they will bury in Topheth till there is no more room <i>and</i> no place else to bury.

<p><sup>33</sup> And the dead bodies of this people will be meat for the fowls of the air and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away.

<p><sup>34</sup> Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.

<h4>8</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> At that time, says the Lord, <font color='#7a8080'>[the Babylonian army will break open the sepulchers, and]</font> they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.

<p><sup>2</sup> And they will <font color='#7a8080'>[carelessly]</font> scatter <font color='#7a8080'>[the corpses]</font> before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which <font color='#7a8080'>[the dead]</font> have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked and which they have sought, inquired of, <i>and</i> required and which they have worshiped. They shall not be gathered, or be buried; they shall be like dung upon the face of the earth.

<p><sup>3</sup> And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of those who remain of this evil family (nation), who remain in all the places to which I have driven them, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>4</sup> Moreover, you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> shall say to them, Thus says the Lord: Shall men fall and not rise up again? Shall one turn away <font color='#7a8080'>[from God]</font> and not repent <i>and</i> return <font color='#7a8080'>[to Him]</font>?

<p><sup>5</sup> Why then is this people of Jerusalem turned away with a perpetual turning away <font color='#7a8080'>[from Me]</font>? They hold fast to deceit (idolatry); they refuse to repent <i>and</i> return <font color='#7a8080'>[to God]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> I have listened and heard, but they have not spoken aright; no man repents of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turns to his <font color='#7a8080'>[individual]</font> course, as the horse rushes like a torrent into battle.

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Even the migratory birds are punctual to their seasons.]</font> Yes, the stork <font color='#7a8080'>[excelling in the great height of her flight]</font> in the heavens knows her appointed times <font color='#7a8080'>[of migration]</font>, and the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane observe the time of their return. But My people do not know the law of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[which the lower animals instinctively recognize in so far as it applies to them]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> How can you say, We are wise, and we have the written law of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[and are learned in its language and teachings]</font>? Behold, the truth is, the lying pen of the scribes has made of the law a falsehood (a mere code of ceremonial observances).

<p><sup>9</sup> The wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken <font color='#7a8080'>[captive]</font>. Behold, they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom <i>and</i> broad, full intelligence is in them?

<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore will I give their wives to others and their fields to those who gain possession of them; for everyone, from the least even to the greatest, is given to covetousness (is greedy for unjust gain); from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.

<p><sup>11</sup> For they have healed the wound of the daughter of My people only lightly <i>and</i> slightingly, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.

<p><sup>12</sup> They are brought to shame because they have committed abominations (extremely disgusting and shamefully vile things). And yet they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time of their punishment they shall be overthrown, says the Lord.

<p><sup>13</sup> I will gather <i>and</i> sweep them away, utterly consuming them, says the Lord. <font color='#7a8080'>[I will find]</font> no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf is withered; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them <font color='#7a8080'>[for I have appointed to them those who shall pass over them]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Then say the people to each other]</font> Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities and be silent <i>or</i> perish there! For the Lord our God has decreed our ruin and given us bitter <i>and</i> poisonous water to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.

<p><sup>15</sup> We looked for peace <i>and</i> completeness, but no good came, and for a time of healing, but behold, dismay, trouble, <i>and</i> terror!

<p><sup>16</sup> The snorting of <font color='#7a8080'>[Nebuchadnezzar's]</font> horses is heard from Dan <font color='#7a8080'>[on the northern border of Palestine]</font>. At the sound of the neighing of his strong war-horses the whole land quakes; for they come and devour the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell in it.

<p><sup>17</sup> For behold, I am sending among you serpents, adders which cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you, says the Lord.

<p><sup>18</sup> Oh, that I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> could comfort myself against sorrow, <font color='#7a8080'>[for my grief is beyond healing]</font>, my heart is sick <i>and</i> faint within me!

<p><sup>19</sup> Behold <font color='#7a8080'>[says the prophet, listen to the voice of]</font> the cry of the daughter of my people <font color='#7a8080'>[for help]</font> because of those who dwell in a far country: Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her King in her? <font color='#7a8080'>[But the Lord answers]</font> Why have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images and with foreign idols?

<p><sup>20</sup> The harvest is past, the summer has ended <i>and</i> the gathering of fruit is over, yet we are not saved! <font color='#7a8080'>[comes again the voice of the people.]</font>

<p><sup>21</sup> For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> hurt; I go around mourning; dismay has taken hold on me.

<p><sup>22</sup> Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people restored? <font color='#7a8080'>[Because Zion no longer enjoyed the presence of the Great Physician!]</font>

<h4>9</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Oh, that my head were waters and my eyes a reservoir of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

<p><sup>2</sup> Oh, that I had in the wilderness a lodging place (a mere shelter) for wayfaring men, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers <font color='#7a8080'>[rendering worship to idols instead of to the Lord, Who has espoused the people to Himself]</font>; they are a gang of treacherous men <font color='#7a8080'>[faithless even to each other]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> And they bend their tongue, <font color='#7a8080'>[which is]</font> their bow for the lies <font color='#7a8080'>[they shoot]</font>. And not according to faithfulness do they rule <i>and</i> become strong in the land; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know <i>and</i> understand <i>and</i> acknowledge Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>4</sup> Let everyone beware of his neighbor and put no trust in any brother. For every brother is an utter <i>and</i> complete supplanter (one who takes by the heel and trips up, a deceiver, a Jacob), and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.

<p><sup>5</sup> And they deceive <i>and</i> mock every one his neighbor and do not speak the truth. They have taught their tongues to speak lies; they weary themselves committing iniquity.

<p><sup>6</sup> Your habitation is in the midst of deceit <font color='#7a8080'>[oppression upon oppression and deceit upon deceit]</font>; through deceit they refuse to know <i>and</i> understand Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>7</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will melt them <font color='#7a8080'>[by the process of affliction to remove the dross]</font> and test them, for how else should I deal with the daughter of My people?

<p><sup>8</sup> Their tongue is a murderous arrow; it speaks deceitfully; one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lays snares and waits in ambush for him.

<p><sup>9</sup> Shall I not punish them for these things? says the Lord. Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?

<p><sup>10</sup> For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing and for the pastures of the wilderness a lament, because they are burned up <i>and</i> desolated, so that no one passes through <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font>; neither can men hear <font color='#7a8080'>[any longer]</font> the lowing of cattle. Both the fowls of the air and the beasts have fled, they are gone!

<p><sup>11</sup> I will make Jerusalem heaps <font color='#7a8080'>[of ruins]</font>, a dwelling place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.

<p><sup>12</sup> Who is the wise man who may understand this? To whom has the mouth of the Lord spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined <i>and</i> laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through it?

<p><sup>13</sup> And the Lord says, Because they have forsaken My law, which I set before them, and have not listened to <i>and</i> obeyed My voice or walked in accordance with it

<p><sup>14</sup> But have walked stubbornly after their own hearts and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them,

<p><sup>15</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood and give them bitter <i>and</i> poisonous water to drink.

<p><sup>16</sup> I will scatter them also among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send the sword among them <i>and</i> after them until I have consumed them.

<p><sup>17</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skillful women to come.

<p><sup>18</sup> Let them make haste and raise a wailing over us <i>and</i> for us, that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush with water.

<p><sup>19</sup> For a sound of wailing is heard <font color='#7a8080'>[coming]</font> out of Zion: How we are plundered <i>and</i> ruined! We are greatly confounded <i>and</i> utterly put to shame, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings <font color='#7a8080'>[our dwellings that have cast us out]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> Yet hear the word of the Lord, O you women, and let your ears receive the word of His mouth; teach your daughters a lament, and each one <font color='#7a8080'>[teach]</font> her neighbor a dirge.

<p><sup>21</sup> For death has come up into our windows; it has entered into our palaces, cutting off the children from outdoors and the young men from the streets.

<p><sup>22</sup> Speak, Thus says the Lord: The dead bodies of men shall fall like dung on the open field and like sheaves <font color='#7a8080'>[of grain]</font> behind the reaper, and none shall gather them.

<p><sup>23</sup> Thus says the Lord: Let not the wise <i>and</i> skillful person glory <i>and</i> boast in his wisdom <i>and</i> skill; let not the mighty <i>and</i> powerful person glory <i>and</i> boast in his strength <i>and</i> power; let not the person who is rich <font color='#7a8080'>[in physical gratification and earthly wealth]</font> glory <i>and</i> boast in his <font color='#7a8080'>[temporal satisfactions and earthly]</font> riches;

<p><sup>24</sup> But let him who glories glory in this: that he understands and knows Me <font color='#7a8080'>[personally and practically, directly discerning and recognizing My character]</font>, that I am the Lord, Who practices loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord.

<p><sup>25</sup> Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will punish all who though circumcised <font color='#7a8080'>[outwardly, in the flesh]</font> are still uncircumcised <font color='#7a8080'>[in corresponding inward purity]</font>—

<p><sup>26</sup> Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab <font color='#7a8080'>[all of whom are related except Egypt]</font>, and all who live in the desert and who clip off the corners of their hair <i>and</i> beards; for all these nations are uncircumcised <font color='#7a8080'>[in heart]</font>, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.

<h4>10</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Hear the word which the Lord speaks to you, O house of Israel.

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord: Learn not the way of the <font color='#7a8080'>[heathen]</font> nations and be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens, though they are dismayed at them,

<p><sup>3</sup> For the customs <i>and</i> ordinances of the peoples are false, empty, <i>and</i> futile; it is but a tree which one cuts out of the forest <font color='#7a8080'>[to make for himself a god]</font>, the work of the hands of the craftsman with the ax <i>or</i> other tool.

<p><sup>4</sup> They deck <font color='#7a8080'>[the idol]</font> with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers so it will not fall apart <i>or</i> move around.

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Their idols]</font> are like pillars of turned work <font color='#7a8080'>[as upright and stationary and immobile as a palm tree]</font>, like scarecrows in a cucumber field; they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it possible for them to do good <font color='#7a8080'>[and it is not in them]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> None at all is like You, O Lord; You are great, and Your name is great in might.

<p><sup>7</sup> Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? For it is fitting to You <i>and</i> Your due! For among all the wise <font color='#7a8080'>[men or gods]</font> of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.

<p><sup>8</sup> But they are altogether irrational <i>and</i> stupid and foolish. Their instruction is given by idols who are but wood <font color='#7a8080'>[it is a teaching of falsity, emptiness, futility]</font>!

<p><sup>9</sup> Silver beaten <font color='#7a8080'>[into plates]</font> is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; the <font color='#7a8080'>[idols']</font> clothing is violet and purple—they are all the work of skillful men.

<p><sup>10</sup> But the Lord is the true God <i>and</i> the God of truth (the God Who is Truth). He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes, and the nations are not able to bear His indignation.

<p><sup>11</sup> Thus shall you say to them: The gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.

<p><sup>12</sup> God made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom and by His understanding <i>and</i> skill stretched out the heavens.

<p><sup>13</sup> When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind out from His treasuries <i>and</i> from His storehouses.

<p><sup>14</sup> Every man has become like a brute, irrational <i>and</i> stupid, without knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[of God]</font>; every goldsmith is brought to shame by his graven idols; for his molten images are frauds <i>and</i> falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

<p><sup>15</sup> They are devoid of worth, usefulness, <i>or</i> truth, a work of delusion <i>and</i> mockery; in their time of trial <i>and</i> punishment they shall <font color='#7a8080'>[helplessly]</font> perish.

<p><sup>16</sup> The Portion of Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[the true God on Whom Israel has a claim]</font> is not like these, for He is the Fashioner <i>and</i> Maker of all things, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance—the Lord of hosts is His name.

<p><sup>17</sup> Gather up your bundle <font color='#7a8080'>[of baggage]</font> from the ground, O you who dwell under siege.

<p><sup>18</sup> For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time and will bring distress on them, that they may feel it <i>and</i> find it <font color='#7a8080'>[to be as I have said, and turn to Me]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> Woe is me because of my hurt! <font color='#7a8080'>[says Jeremiah, speaking for the nation.]</font> My wound is grievous <i>and</i> incurable. But I said, Surely this sickness <i>and</i> suffering <i>and</i> grief are mine, and I must endure, tolerate, <i>and</i> bear them.

<p><sup>20</sup> My tent (home) is taken by force <i>and</i> plundered, and all my <font color='#7a8080'>[tent]</font> cords are broken. My children have gone forth <font color='#7a8080'>[as captives]</font> from me, and they are no more; there is no one to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my <font color='#7a8080'>[tent]</font> curtains.

<p><sup>21</sup> For the shepherds <font color='#7a8080'>[of the people]</font> have become like brutes, irrational <i>and</i> stupid, and have not sought the Lord <i>or</i> inquired of Him <i>or</i> required Him <font color='#7a8080'>[by necessity and by right of His word]</font>. Therefore they have not dealt prudently <i>and</i> have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.

<p><sup>22</sup> Hark, the sound of a rumor! <font color='#7a8080'>[The invading army]</font> comes!—a great commotion out of the north country—to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling place of jackals.

<p><sup>23</sup> O Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[pleads Jeremiah in the name of the people]</font>, I know that <font color='#7a8080'>[the determination of]</font> the way of a man is not in himself; it is not in man <font color='#7a8080'>[even in a strong man or in a man at his best]</font> to direct his <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> steps.

<p><sup>24</sup> O Lord, correct, instruct, <i>and</i> chastise me, but with judgment <i>and</i> in just measure—not in Your anger, lest You diminish me <i>and</i> bring me to nothing.

<p><sup>25</sup> Pour out Your wrath upon the nations that do not know <i>or</i> recognize You and upon the peoples that do not call upon Your name. For they have devoured Jacob, yes, devoured him and consumed him and made his habitation a desolate waste.

<h4>11</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:

<p><sup>2</sup> Hear the words of this covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>3</sup> Say to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge

<p><sup>4</sup> Which I commanded your fathers at the time that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to My voice and do according to all that I command you. So will you be My people, and I will be your God,

<p><sup>5</sup> That I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered, Amen (so be it), O Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> And the Lord said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge and do them.

<p><sup>7</sup> For I earnestly protested to <i>and</i> warned your fathers at the time that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, protesting to <i>and</i> warning them persistently, saying, Obey My voice.

<p><sup>8</sup> Yet they did not obey or incline their ear <font color='#7a8080'>[to Me]</font>, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his own evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all <font color='#7a8080'>[the calamities threatened in]</font> the words of this covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge, which I had commanded, but they did not do.

<p><sup>9</sup> And the Lord said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>10</sup> They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words; they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge which I made with their fathers.

<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I am bringing evil <i>and</i> calamity upon them which they will not be able to escape; though they cry to Me, I will not listen to them.

<p><sup>12</sup> Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense, but they cannot save them at all in the time of their evil trouble.

<p><sup>13</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[as many as]</font> the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah; and <font color='#7a8080'>[as many as]</font> the number of the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore do not pray for this people or lift up a cry or prayer for them, for I will not listen when they cry out to Me in the time of their evil trouble.

<p><sup>15</sup> What right has My beloved <font color='#7a8080'>[to be]</font> in My house when she has wrought lewdness <i>and</i> done treacherously many times? Can vows <i>and</i> the holy flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[of your sacrifices]</font> remove from you your wickedness <i>and</i> avert your calamity? Can you by these <font color='#7a8080'>[escape your doom and]</font> rejoice exultantly?

<p><sup>16</sup> The Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[acknowledged you once to be worthy to be]</font> called a green olive tree, fair <i>and</i> of good fruit; but with the roar of a great tempest He will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed.

<p><sup>17</sup> For the Lord of hosts, Who planted you, has pronounced evil <i>and</i> calamity against you because of the evil which the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done against themselves in provoking Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.

<p><sup>18</sup> And the Lord gave me <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> knowledge of it <font color='#7a8080'>[their plot]</font>, and I knew it; then You <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> showed me their doings.

<p><sup>19</sup> But I was like a tame lamb that is brought to the slaughter; I did not know that they had devised inventions <i>and</i> schemes against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.

<p><sup>20</sup> But, O Lord of hosts, Who judges rightly <i>and</i> justly, Who tests the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for to You I have revealed <i>and</i> committed my cause <font color='#7a8080'>[rolling it upon You]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord about the men of Anathoth <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah's hometown]</font>, who seek your life <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> and say, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord, that you die not by our hands—

<p><sup>22</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and their daughters will die by famine;

<p><sup>23</sup> And there will be no remnant <font color='#7a8080'>[of the conspirators]</font> left, for I will bring evil <i>and</i> calamity upon the men of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.

<h4>12</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Uncompromisingly righteous <i>and</i> rigidly just are You, O Lord, when I complain against <i>and</i> contend with You. Yet let me plead <i>and</i> reason the case with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all they at ease <i>and</i> thriving who deal very treacherously <i>and</i> deceitfully?

<p><sup>2</sup> You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit. You are near in their mouths but far from their hearts.

<p><sup>3</sup> But You, O Lord, know <i>and</i> understand me <i>and</i> my devotion to You; You see me and try my heart toward You. <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> pull <font color='#7a8080'>[these rebellious ones]</font> out like sheep for the slaughter and devote <i>and</i> prepare them for the day of slaughter.

<p><sup>4</sup> How long must the land mourn and the grass <i>and</i> herbs of the whole country wither? Through the wickedness of those who dwell in it, the beasts and the birds are consumed <i>and</i> are swept away <font color='#7a8080'>[by the drought]</font>, because men <font color='#7a8080'>[mocked]</font> me, saying, He shall not <font color='#7a8080'>[live to]</font> see our final end.

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But the Lord rebukes Jeremiah's impatience, saying]</font> If you have raced with men on foot and they have tired you out, then how can you compete with horses? And if <font color='#7a8080'>[you take to flight]</font> in a land of peace where you feel secure, then what will you do <font color='#7a8080'>[when you tread the tangled maze of jungle haunted by lions]</font> in the swelling <i>and</i> flooding of the Jordan?

<p><sup>6</sup> For even your brethren and the house of your father—even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes, even they are <font color='#7a8080'>[like a pack of hounds]</font> in full cry after you. Believe them not, though they speak fair words <i>and</i> promise good things to you.

<p><sup>7</sup> I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of My life into the hands of her enemies.

<p><sup>8</sup> My heritage has become to Me like a lion in the forest; she has uttered her voice against Me; therefore I have <font color='#7a8080'>[treated her as if I]</font> hated her.

<p><sup>9</sup> Is My heritage to Me like a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Go, assemble all the wild beasts of the field; bring them to devour.

<p><sup>10</sup> Many shepherds <font color='#7a8080'>[of an invading host]</font> have destroyed My vineyard, they have trampled My portion underfoot; they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.

<p><sup>11</sup> They have made it a desolation, and desolate it mourns before Me; the whole land has been made desolate, but no man lays it to heart.

<p><sup>12</sup> Destroyers have come upon all the bare heights in the desert, for the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the land even to the other; no flesh has peace <i>or</i> can find the means to escape.

<p><sup>13</sup> They have sown wheat but have reaped thorns; they have worn themselves out but without profit. And they shall be ashamed of your <font color='#7a8080'>[lack of]</font> harvests <i>and</i> revenues because of the fierce <i>and</i> glowing anger of the Lord.

<p><sup>14</sup> Thus says the Lord against all My evil neighbor <font color='#7a8080'>[nations]</font> who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from their land and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.

<p><sup>15</sup> And after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them and will bring them back again, every man to his heritage and every man to his land.

<p><sup>16</sup> And if these <font color='#7a8080'>[neighbor nations]</font> will diligently learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, saying, As the Lord lives—even as they taught My people to swear by Baal—then will they be built up in the midst of My people.

<p><sup>17</sup> But if any nation will not hear and obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, says the Lord.

<h4>13</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus the Lord said to me: Go and buy yourself a linen girdle and put it on your loins, but do not put it in water.

<p><sup>2</sup> So I bought a girdle <i>or</i> waistcloth, according to the word of the Lord, and put it on my loins.

<p><sup>3</sup> And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying,

<p><sup>4</sup> Take the girdle which you have bought, which is on your loins, and arise, go to the <font color='#7a8080'>[river]</font> Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.

<p><sup>5</sup> So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.

<p><sup>6</sup> And after many days the Lord said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the girdle which I commanded you to hide there.

<p><sup>7</sup> Then I went to the Euphrates and dug and took the girdle <i>or</i> waistcloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the girdle was decayed <i>and</i> spoiled; it was good for nothing.

<p><sup>8</sup> Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

<p><sup>9</sup> Thus says the Lord: After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>10</sup> These evil people, who refuse to hear My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them, shall even be like this girdle <i>or</i> waistcloth, which is profitable for nothing.

<p><sup>11</sup> For as the girdle clings to the loins of a man, so I caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me, says the Lord, that they might be for Me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory; but they would not listen <i>or</i> obey.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Every bottle <i>and</i> jar should be filled with wine. <font color='#7a8080'>[The people]</font> will say to you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle <i>and</i> jar should be filled with wine?

<p><sup>13</sup> Then say to them, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit upon David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>14</sup> And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the Lord. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.

<p><sup>15</sup> Hear and give ear, do not be proud, for the Lord has spoken <font color='#7a8080'>[says Jeremiah]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> Give glory to the Lord your God before He brings darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark <i>and</i> twilit mountains, and <font color='#7a8080'>[before]</font>, while you are looking for light, He turns it into the shadow of death and makes it thick darkness.

<p><sup>17</sup> But if you will not hear <i>and</i> obey, I will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the Lord's flock has been taken captive.

<p><sup>18</sup> Say to the king and the queen mother, Humble yourselves <i>and</i> take a lowly seat, for down from your head has come your beautiful crown (the crown of your glory).

<p><sup>19</sup> The cities of the South (the Negeb) have been shut up, and there is no one to open them; all Judah has been carried away captive, it has been wholly taken captive <i>and</i> into exile.

<p><sup>20</sup> Lift up your eyes and behold those <font color='#7a8080'>[the eruption of a hostile army]</font> who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you <font color='#7a8080'>[to shepherd]</font>, your beautiful flock?

<p><sup>21</sup> What will you say <font color='#7a8080'>[O Jerusalem]</font> when He <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> sets over you as head those <font color='#7a8080'>[tyrannical foreign nations]</font> whom you yourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[at intervals]</font> have taught to be lovers (allies) with you <font color='#7a8080'>[instructing them, even your friends, to be head over you]</font>? Will not pangs take hold of you like that of a woman in travail?

<p><sup>22</sup> And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come upon me?—<font color='#7a8080'>[the answer is]</font>, Because of the greatness of your iniquity has your long robe been pulled aside <font color='#7a8080'>[showing you in the garb of a menial]</font> <i>and</i> have you <font color='#7a8080'>[barefooted and treated like a slave]</font> suffered violence.

<p><sup>23</sup> Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also can you do good who are accustomed <i>and</i> taught <font color='#7a8080'>[even trained]</font> to do evil.

<p><sup>24</sup> Therefore I will scatter you like chaff driven away by the wind from the desert.

<p><sup>25</sup> This is your lot, the portion measured to you from Me, says the Lord, because you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood <font color='#7a8080'>[false gods and alliances with idolatrous nations]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> Therefore I Myself will <font color='#7a8080'>[retaliate]</font>, throwing your skirts up over your face, that your shame <font color='#7a8080'>[of being clad like a slave]</font> may be exposed.

<p><sup>27</sup> I have seen your detestable acts, even your adulteries and your lustful neighings <font color='#7a8080'>[after idols]</font>, and the lewdness of your harlotry on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! For how long a time yet will you not <font color='#7a8080'>[meet My conditions and]</font> be made clean?

<h4>14</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:

<p><sup>2</sup> Judah mourns and her gates languish; <font color='#7a8080'>[her people]</font> sit in black <font color='#7a8080'>[mourning garb]</font> upon the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.

<p><sup>3</sup> And their nobles send their little ones <i>and</i> their inferiors for water; they come to the cisterns and find no water. They return with empty vessels; they are put to shame and confounded and cover their heads.

<p><sup>4</sup> Because the ground is cracked <i>and</i> the tillers are dismayed, since there has been no rain on the land, the plowmen are put to shame, and they cover their heads.

<p><sup>5</sup> Yes, even the hind gives birth to her calf in the field and forsakes it, because there is no grass <i>or</i> herbage.

<p><sup>6</sup> And the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; they pant for air like jackals <i>or</i> crocodiles; their eyesight fails because there is no grass.

<p><sup>7</sup> O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us <font color='#7a8080'>[prays Jeremiah]</font>, deal <i>and</i> work with us for Your own name's sake <font color='#7a8080'>[that the heathen may witness Your might and faithfulness]</font>! For our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.

<p><sup>8</sup> O Hope of Israel, her Savior in time of trouble, why should You be like a sojourner in the land and like a wayfaring man who turns aside <i>and</i> spreads his tent to tarry <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> for a night?

<p><sup>9</sup> Why should You be <font color='#7a8080'>[hesitant and inactive]</font> like a man stunned <i>and</i> confused, like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet You, O Lord, are in the midst of us, and we are called by Your name; do not leave us!

<p><sup>10</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[And the Lord replied to Jeremiah]</font> Thus says the Lord to this people <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font>: In the manner <i>and</i> to the degree already pointed out have they loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet. Therefore the Lord does not accept them; He will now <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember their iniquity and punish them for their sins.

<p><sup>11</sup> The Lord said to me, Do not pray for this people for their good.

<p><sup>12</sup> Though they fast, I will not hear their cry; and though they offer burnt offering and cereal offering <font color='#7a8080'>[without heartfelt surrender to Me, or by offering it too late]</font>, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.

<p><sup>13</sup> Then said I, Alas, Lord God! Behold, the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets say to them, You will not see the sword, nor will you have famine; but I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> will give you assured peace (peace that lasts, the peace of truth) in this place.

<p><sup>14</sup> Then the Lord said to me, The <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets prophesy lies in My name. I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor have I spoken to them. They prophesy to you a false <i>or</i> pretended vision, a worthless divination <font color='#7a8080'>[conjuring or practicing magic, trying to call forth the responses supposed to be given by idols]</font>, and the deceit of their own minds.

<p><sup>15</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets who prophesy in My name—although I did not send them—and who say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.

<p><sup>16</sup> And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword; and they shall have none to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness upon them <font color='#7a8080'>[and not on their false teachers only, for the people could not have been deceived except by their own consent]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> Therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> you shall say to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people has been smitten with a great wound, with a very grievous blow.

<p><sup>18</sup> If I go out into the field, then behold, those slain with the sword! And if I enter the city, then behold, those tormented with the diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest go about not knowing what to do <i>or</i> as beggars <font color='#7a8080'>[exiled]</font> in a land that they know not, and they have no knowledge.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> have You utterly rejected Judah? Do You loathe Zion? Why have You smitten us so that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace <i>and</i> completeness, but no good came, and for a time of healing, but behold, dismay, disaster, <i>and</i> terror!

<p><sup>20</sup> We know <i>and</i> acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.

<p><sup>21</sup> Do not abhor, condemn, <i>and</i> spurn us, for Your name's sake; do not dishonor, debase, <i>and</i> lightly esteem Your glorious throne; <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember, break not Your covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge with us.

<p><sup>22</sup> Are there any among the false gods of the nations who can cause rain? Or can the heavens <font color='#7a8080'>[of their own will]</font> give showers? Are You <font color='#7a8080'>[alone]</font> not He, O Lord our God? Therefore we will wait <font color='#7a8080'>[expectantly]</font> for You, for You have made all these things <font color='#7a8080'>[the heavens and the rain]</font>.

<h4>15</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then the Lord said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood <font color='#7a8080'>[interceding for them]</font> before Me, yet My mind could not be turned with favor toward this people <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font>. Send them out of My sight and let them go!

<p><sup>2</sup> And if they say to you, Where shall we go? then tell them, Thus says the Lord: Such as are <font color='#7a8080'>[destined]</font> for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for famine, to famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.

<p><sup>3</sup> And I will appoint over them four kinds <font color='#7a8080'>[of destroyers]</font>, says the Lord: the sword to slay, the dogs to tear <i>and</i> drag away, and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy.

<p><sup>4</sup> And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth <i>and</i> to be made a horror to all nations because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for <font color='#7a8080'>[the horrible wickedness]</font> which he did in Jerusalem.

<p><sup>5</sup> For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who will bemoan you? Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?

<p><sup>6</sup> You have rejected <i>and</i> forsaken Me, says the Lord. You keep going in reverse. Therefore I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am weary of relenting <font color='#7a8080'>[concerning your punishment]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> I will winnow them with a fan <i>and</i> a winnowing fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave them <font color='#7a8080'>[of children]</font>, I will destroy My people; from their <font color='#7a8080'>[evil]</font> ways they did not return.

<p><sup>8</sup> I will increase the number of their widows more than the sand of the seas. I will bring upon them, <font color='#7a8080'>[both]</font> against the mother of young men <i>and</i> the young men <font color='#7a8080'>[themselves]</font>, a destroyer at noonday. I will cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> suddenly.

<p><sup>9</sup> She who has borne seven languishes; she has expired. Her sun has gone down while it was yet day; she has been put to shame, confounded, <i>and</i> disgraced. And the rest of them I will deliver to the sword before their enemies, says the Lord.

<p><sup>10</sup> Woe is me, my mother, that you bore me to be a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither loaned, nor have men loaned to me, yet everyone curses me.

<p><sup>11</sup> The Lord said, Truly your release, affliction, <i>and</i> strengthening will be for good <font color='#7a8080'>[purposes]</font>; surely <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> I will intercede for you with the enemy <i>and</i> I will cause the enemy to ask for your aid in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.

<p><sup>12</sup> Can iron break the iron from the north and the bronze?

<p><sup>13</sup> Your <font color='#7a8080'>[nation's]</font> substance and your treasures will I give as spoil, without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your territory.

<p><sup>14</sup> And I will make <font color='#7a8080'>[your possessions]</font> to pass with your enemies into a land which you do not know <i>and</i> I will make you to serve <font color='#7a8080'>[your conquerors]</font> there, for a fire is kindled in My anger which will burn upon you <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah said]</font> O Lord, You know <i>and</i> understand; <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember me and visit me and avenge me on my persecutors. Take me not away <font color='#7a8080'>[from joy or from life itself]</font> in Your long-suffering <font color='#7a8080'>[to my enemies]</font>; know that for Your sake I suffer <i>and</i> bear reproach.

<p><sup>16</sup> Your words were found, and I ate them; and Your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart, for I am called by Your name, O Lord God of hosts.

<p><sup>17</sup> I sat not in the assembly of those who make merry, nor did I rejoice; I sat alone because Your <font color='#7a8080'>[powerful]</font> hand was upon me, for You had filled me with indignation.

<p><sup>18</sup> Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will you indeed be to me like a deceitful brook, like waters that fail <i>and</i> are uncertain?

<p><sup>19</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[to Jeremiah]</font>: If you return <font color='#7a8080'>[and give up this mistaken tone of distrust and despair]</font>, then I will give you again a settled place of quiet <i>and</i> safety, and you will be My minister; and if you separate the precious from the vile <font color='#7a8080'>[cleansing your own heart from unworthy and unwarranted suspicions concerning God's faithfulness]</font>, you shall be My mouthpiece. <font color='#7a8080'>[But do not yield to them.]</font> Let them return to you—not you to <font color='#7a8080'>[the people]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> And I will make you to this people a fortified, bronze wall; they will fight against you, but they will not prevail over you, for I am with you to save <i>and</i> deliver you, says the Lord.

<p><sup>21</sup> And I will deliver you out of the hands of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the palms of the terrible <i>and</i> ruthless tyrants.

<h4>16</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord came also to me, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> You shall not take a wife or have sons and daughters in this place <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who begot them in this land:

<p><sup>4</sup> They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried, but they shall be like dung upon the face of the ground. They shall perish <i>and</i> be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the fowls of the air and for the beasts of the earth.

<p><sup>5</sup> For thus says the Lord: Enter not into the house of mourning, nor go to lament or bemoan <font color='#7a8080'>[the dead]</font>, for I have taken away My peace from this people, says the Lord, even My steadfast love <i>and</i> loving-kindness and tender mercy.

<p><sup>6</sup> Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them or cut themselves or make themselves bald for them.

<p><sup>7</sup> Neither shall men prepare food for the mourners to comfort them for the dead; nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.

<p><sup>8</sup> And you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink.

<p><sup>9</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease from this place before your very eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.

<p><sup>10</sup> And when you tell these people all these words and they inquire of you, Why has the Lord decreed all this enormous evil against us? Or, What is our iniquity? Or, What is the sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?

<p><sup>11</sup> Then you shall say to them, <font color='#7a8080'>[It is]</font> because your fathers have forsaken Me, says the Lord, and have walked after other gods and have served and worshiped them and have forsaken Me and have not kept My law,

<p><sup>12</sup> And because you have done worse than your fathers. For behold, every one of you walks after the stubbornness of his own evil heart, so that you do not listen to <i>and</i> obey Me.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore I will cast you out of this land <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> into the land <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Babylonians]</font> neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor there.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when it shall no more be said, As the Lord lives, Who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,

<p><sup>15</sup> But, As the Lord lives, Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries to which He had driven them. And I will bring them again to their land which I gave to their fathers.

<p><sup>16</sup> Behold, I will send for many fishers, says the Lord, and they will fish them out; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the clefts of the rocks.

<p><sup>17</sup> For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, neither is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.

<p><sup>18</sup> First <font color='#7a8080'>[before I bring them back to their land]</font> I will doubly recompense <i>and</i> punish them for their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted My land with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with the abominable things offered to false gods with which they have filled My inheritance.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Then said Jeremiah]</font> O Lord, my Strength and my Stronghold, and my Refuge in the day of affliction, to You shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, emptiness, <i>and</i> futility, worthless things in which there is no profit!

<p><sup>20</sup> Can a man make gods for himself? Such are not gods!

<p><sup>21</sup> Therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font> behold, I will make them know—<font color='#7a8080'>[yes]</font> this once I will make them know My power and My might; and they will know <i>and</i> recognize that My name is the Lord.

<h4>17</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The sin of Judah is written with a pen <i>or</i> stylus of iron and with the point of a diamond; it is engraved on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars,

<p><sup>2</sup> While their children <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember their <font color='#7a8080'>[heathen]</font> altars and their Asherim <font color='#7a8080'>[wooden symbols of the goddess Asherah]</font> beside the green trees upon the high hills.

<p><sup>3</sup> O <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> My mountain in the field, I will give your wealth <i>and</i> all your treasures to the spoil and your high places for sin <font color='#7a8080'>[as the price of your sin]</font> throughout all your territory.

<p><sup>4</sup> And you, through your own fault, will loosen your hand <i>and</i> discontinue from your heritage which I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in a land which you do not know, for you have kindled a fire in My anger which will burn throughout the ages.

<p><sup>5</sup> Thus says the Lord: Cursed <font color='#7a8080'>[with great evil]</font> is the strong man who trusts in <i>and</i> relies on frail man, making weak <font color='#7a8080'>[human]</font> flesh his arm, and whose mind <i>and</i> heart turn aside from the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> For he shall be like a shrub <i>or</i> a person naked and destitute in the desert; and he shall not see any good come, but shall dwell in the parched places in the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Most]</font> blessed is the man who believes in, trusts in, <i>and</i> relies on the Lord, and whose hope <i>and</i> confidence the Lord is.

<p><sup>8</sup> For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its roots by the river; and it shall not see <i>and</i> fear when heat comes; but its leaf shall be green. It shall not be anxious <i>and</i> full of care in the year of drought, nor shall it cease yielding fruit.

<p><sup>9</sup> The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly perverse <i>and</i> corrupt and severely, mortally sick! Who can know it <font color='#7a8080'>[perceive, understand, be acquainted with his own heart and mind]</font>?

<p><sup>10</sup> I the Lord search the mind, I try the heart, even to give to every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.

<p><sup>11</sup> Like the partridge that gathers a brood which she did not hatch <i>and</i> sits on eggs which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches by unjust means <i>and</i> not by right. He will leave them, <i>or</i> they will leave him, in the midst of his days, and at his end he will be a fool.

<p><sup>12</sup> A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary (the temple).

<p><sup>13</sup> O Lord, the Hope of Israel, all who forsake You shall be put to shame. They who depart from You <i>and</i> me <font color='#7a8080'>[Your prophet]</font> shall <font color='#7a8080'>[disappear like]</font> writing upon the ground, because they have forsaken the Lord, the Fountain of living waters.

<p><sup>14</sup> Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for You are my praise.

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[predicting the disaster that you said would befall us]</font>? Let it come now!

<p><sup>16</sup> But as for me, I have not sought to escape from being a shepherd after You, nor have I desired the woeful day <font color='#7a8080'>[of judgment]</font>; You know that. Whatever I said was spoken in Your presence <i>and</i> was from You.

<p><sup>17</sup> Be not a terror to me; You are my refuge <i>and</i> my hope in the day of evil.

<p><sup>18</sup> Let those be put to shame who persecute me, but let me not be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.

<p><sup>19</sup> Thus said the Lord to me: Go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people, through which the kings of Judah enter and through which they go out, and also <font color='#7a8080'>[stand]</font> in all the gates of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>20</sup> Say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates.

<p><sup>21</sup> Thus says the Lord: Take heed to yourselves <i>and</i> for the sake of your lives bear no burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>22</sup> And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy (set apart to the worship of God), as I commanded your fathers.

<p><sup>23</sup> Yet they would not listen <i>and</i> obey or incline their ears; but they stiffened their necks, that they might not hear and might not receive instruction.

<p><sup>24</sup> But if you diligently listen to <i>and</i> obey Me, says the Lord, and bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy (set apart to the worship of God), to do no work on it,

<p><sup>25</sup> Then there will enter through the gates of this city kings and princes who will sit upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—the kings and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will be inhabited <i>and</i> last throughout the ages.

<p><sup>26</sup> And people shall come from the cities of Judah and the places round about Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country, and from the South (the Negeb), bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, cereal offerings and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>27</sup> But if you will not listen to Me to keep the Sabbath day holy (set apart to the worship of God), and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem <font color='#7a8080'>[with one]</font> on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in her gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

<h4>18</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord:

<p><sup>2</sup> Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was working at the wheel.

<p><sup>4</sup> And the vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he made it over, reworking it into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then the word of the Lord came to me:

<p><sup>6</sup> O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.

<p><sup>7</sup> At one time I will suddenly speak concerning a nation or kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it;

<p><sup>8</sup> And if <font color='#7a8080'>[the people of]</font> that nation concerning which I have spoken turn from their evil, I will relent <i>and</i> reverse My decision concerning the evil that I thought to do to them.

<p><sup>9</sup> At another time I will suddenly speak concerning a nation or kingdom, that I will build up and plant it;

<p><sup>10</sup> And if they do evil in My sight, obeying not My voice, then I will regret <i>and</i> reverse My decision concerning the good with which I said I would benefit them.

<p><sup>11</sup> Now therefore say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return now each one from his evil way; reform your <font color='#7a8080'>[accustomed]</font> ways <i>and</i> make your <font color='#7a8080'>[individual]</font> actions good <i>and</i> right.

<p><sup>12</sup> But they will say, That is in vain! For we will walk after our own devices, and we will each do as the stubbornness of his own evil heart dictates.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Ask now among the nations: Who has heard such things? Virgin Israel has done a very vile <i>and</i> horrible thing.

<p><sup>14</sup> Will the snow of Mount Lebanon fail <i>and</i> vanish from its rocks <font color='#7a8080'>[which tower above the land of Israel]</font>? Will the cold, rushing waters of strange lands <font color='#7a8080'>[that dash down from afar]</font> be dried up?

<p><sup>15</sup> Yet My people have forgotten Me; they burn incense to false gods, they have been caused to stumble in their ways and in the ancient roads, to walk in bypaths, in a way not graded <i>and</i> built up <font color='#7a8080'>[not on a highway]</font>,

<p><sup>16</sup> Making their land a desolation <i>and</i> a horror, a thing to be hissed at perpetually; everyone who passes by shall be astounded <i>and</i> horrified and shake his head.

<p><sup>17</sup> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them My back and not My face in the day of their calamity <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> Then <font color='#7a8080'>[my enemies]</font> said, Come and let us devise schemes against Jeremiah; for the law <font color='#7a8080'>[of Moses]</font> shall not perish from the priest <font color='#7a8080'>[as this false prophet Jeremiah predicts]</font>, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue <font color='#7a8080'>[making a charge against him to the king]</font>, and let us not pay any attention to his words.

<p><sup>19</sup> Give heed to me, Lord; listen to <font color='#7a8080'>[what]</font> my adversaries <font color='#7a8080'>[are plotting to do to me—and intercede]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> Shall evil be recompensed for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. <font color='#7a8080'>[Earnestly]</font> remember that I stood before You to speak good for them, to turn away Your anger from them.

<p><sup>21</sup> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine; give them over to the power of the sword. And let their wives become childless and widows; let their men meet death by pestilence, their young men be slain by the sword in battle.

<p><sup>22</sup> Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring a troop upon them, for they have dug a pit to take me and have hidden snares for my feet.

<p><sup>23</sup> Yet, Lord, You know all their plotting against me to slay me. Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from Your sight. But let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.

<h4>19</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord: Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take some of the old people and some of the elderly priests

<p><sup>2</sup> And go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom <font color='#7a8080'>[son of Hinnom]</font>, which is by the entrance of the Potsherd Gate; and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you,

<p><sup>3</sup> And say, Hear the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am going to bring such evil upon this place that the ears of whoever hears of it will tingle.

<p><sup>4</sup> Because the people have forsaken Me and have estranged <i>and</i> profaned this place <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> by burning incense in it to other gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents

<p><sup>5</sup> And have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not nor spoke of it, nor did it come into My mind <i>and</i> heart—

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when this place shall no more be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom <font color='#7a8080'>[son of Hinnom]</font>, but the Valley of Slaughter.

<p><sup>7</sup> And I will pour out <i>and</i> make void the counsel <i>and</i> the plans of <font color='#7a8080'>[the men of]</font> Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives, and their dead bodies I will give to be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.

<p><sup>8</sup> And I will make this city an astonishment <i>and</i> a horror and a hissing; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss <font color='#7a8080'>[in scorn]</font> because of all its plagues <i>and</i> disasters.

<p><sup>9</sup> And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and they shall eat each one the flesh of his neighbor <i>and</i> friend in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives distress them.

<p><sup>10</sup> Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who accompany you,

<p><sup>11</sup> And say to them, Thus said the Lord of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city as one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it cannot be mended. Men will bury in Topheth because there will be no other place for burial <i>and</i> until there is no more room to bury.

<p><sup>12</sup> Thus will I do to this place, says the Lord, and to its inhabitants; and I will even make this city like Topheth.

<p><sup>13</sup> And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be like the place of Topheth—even all the houses upon whose roofs incense has been burned to all the host of the heavens and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods.

<p><sup>14</sup> Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the Lord's house and said to all the people,

<p><sup>15</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their necks, refusing to hear My words.

<h4>20</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now Pashhur son of Immer, the priest, who was <font color='#7a8080'>[also]</font> chief officer in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.

<p><sup>2</sup> Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate by the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>3</sup> And the next day Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, The Lord does not call your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib <font color='#7a8080'>[terror on every side]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; they will fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon; he will carry them captive to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.

<p><sup>5</sup> Moreover, I will deliver all the riches of this city—all the results of its labors, all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah—into the hand of their enemies, who will make them a prey <i>and</i> plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.

<p><sup>6</sup> And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; you shall go to Babylon, and there you shall die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But Jeremiah said]</font> O Lord, You have persuaded <i>and</i> deceived me, and I was persuaded <i>and</i> deceived; You are stronger than I am and You have prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me.

<p><sup>8</sup> For whenever I speak, I must cry out <i>and</i> complain; I shout, Violence and destruction! For the word of the Lord has become to me a reproach and a derision <i>and</i> has brought me insult all day long.

<p><sup>9</sup> If I say, I will not make mention of <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> or speak any more in His name, in my mind <i>and</i> heart it is as if there were a burning fire shut up in my bones. And I am weary of enduring <i>and</i> holding it in; I cannot <font color='#7a8080'>[contain it any longer]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> For I have heard many whispering <i>and</i> defaming, <font color='#7a8080'>[There is]</font> terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him! Say all my familiar friends, they who watch for my fall, Perhaps he will be persuaded <i>and</i> deceived; then we will prevail against him, and we will get our revenge on him.

<p><sup>11</sup> But the Lord is with me as a mighty <i>and</i> terrible One; therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not overcome <font color='#7a8080'>[me]</font>. They will be utterly put to shame, for they will not deal wisely <i>or</i> prosper <font color='#7a8080'>[in their schemes]</font>; their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.

<p><sup>12</sup> But, O Lord of hosts, You Who try the righteous, Who see the heart and the mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for to You have I revealed <i>and</i> committed my cause.

<p><sup>13</sup> Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For He has delivered the life of the poor <i>and</i> needy from the hands of evildoers.

<p><sup>14</sup> Cursed be the day on which I was born! Let not the day on which my mother bore me be blessed!

<p><sup>15</sup> Cursed be the man who brought the tidings to my father, saying, A son is born to you!—making him very glad.

<p><sup>16</sup> And let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew, and did not relent. Let him hear the <font color='#7a8080'>[war]</font> cry in the morning and the shouting of alarm at noon,

<p><sup>17</sup> Because he did not slay me in the womb, so that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb always great.

<p><sup>18</sup> Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame?

<h4>21</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Inquire, I pray you, of the Lord for us, for  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the Lord will deal with us according to all His wonderful works, forcing him to withdraw from us.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then said Jeremiah to them, Say this to Zedekiah:

<p><sup>4</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back <i>and</i> dull the edge of the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls; and I will bring them into the midst of this city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm in anger, in fury, and in great indignation <i>and</i> wrath.

<p><sup>6</sup> And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence.

<p><sup>7</sup> And afterward, says the Lord, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their lives. And he will smite them with the edge of the sword; he will not spare them nor have pity or mercy <i>and</i> compassion upon them.

<p><sup>8</sup> And to this people you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> shall say, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.

<p><sup>9</sup> He who remains in this city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> shall die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence. But he who goes out and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him his only booty <font color='#7a8080'>[as a prize of war]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> For I have set My face against this city for evil and not for good, says the Lord. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

<p><sup>11</sup> And concerning the royal house of the king of Judah, hear the word of the Lord:

<p><sup>12</sup> O house of David, thus says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed, lest My wrath go forth like fire and burn so that none can quench it—because of the evil of your doings.

<p><sup>13</sup> Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, O rock of the plain, says the Lord—you who say, Who shall come down against us? Or, Who shall enter into our dwelling places?

<p><sup>14</sup> And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the Lord. I will kindle a fire in your forest, and it will devour all that is round about you.

<h4>22</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word:

<p><sup>2</sup> Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, you who sit upon the throne of David—you and your servants and your people who enter by these gates.

<p><sup>3</sup> Thus says the Lord: Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver out of the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong; do no violence to the stranger <i>or</i> temporary resident, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.

<p><sup>4</sup> For if you will indeed obey this word, then will there enter in through the gates of this <font color='#7a8080'>[the king's]</font> house kings sitting <font color='#7a8080'>[for David]</font> upon David's throne, riding in chariots and on horses—they and their servants and their people.

<p><sup>5</sup> But if you will not hear these words, I swear by Myself, says the Lord, that this house will become a desolation.

<p><sup>6</sup> For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah: <font color='#7a8080'>[If you will not listen to Me, though]</font> you are <font color='#7a8080'>[as valuable]</font> to Me as <font color='#7a8080'>[the fat pastures of]</font> Gilead <font color='#7a8080'>[east of the Jordan]</font> or as the <font color='#7a8080'>[plentiful]</font> summit of Lebanon <font color='#7a8080'>[west of the Jordan]</font>, yet surely I will make you a wilderness and uninhabited cities.

<p><sup>7</sup> And I will prepare, solemnly set apart, <i>and</i> appoint <font color='#7a8080'>[to execute My judgments against you]</font> destroyers, each with his weapons, and they will cut down your <font color='#7a8080'>[palaces built of]</font> choicest cedars and cast them into the fire.

<p><sup>8</sup> And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, Why has the Lord done this to this great city?

<p><sup>9</sup> Then they will answer, Because <font color='#7a8080'>[the people]</font> forsook the covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge with the Lord their God and worshiped other gods and served them.

<p><sup>10</sup> Weep not for him who is dead nor bemoan him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away <font color='#7a8080'>[into captivity]</font>, for he shall return no more nor see his native country <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father and who went forth out of this place: <font color='#7a8080'>[Shallum]</font> shall not return here any more;

<p><sup>12</sup> But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and he shall see this land no more.

<p><sup>13</sup> Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness and his <font color='#7a8080'>[upper]</font> chambers by injustice, who uses his neighbor's service without wages and does not give him his pay <font color='#7a8080'>[for his work]</font>,

<p><sup>14</sup> Who says, I will build myself a wide house with large rooms, and he cuts himself out windows, and it is ceiled <i>or</i> paneled with cedar and painted with vermilion.

<p><sup>15</sup> Do you think that being a king <font color='#7a8080'>[merely]</font> means <font color='#7a8080'>[self-indulgent]</font> vying <font color='#7a8080'>[with Solomon]</font> <i>and</i> striving to excel in cedar <font color='#7a8080'>[palaces]</font>? Did not your father <font color='#7a8080'>[Josiah]</font>, as he ate and drank, do justice and righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[being upright and in right standing with God]</font>? Then it was well with him.

<p><sup>16</sup> He judged <i>and</i> defended the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not <font color='#7a8080'>[all]</font> this <font color='#7a8080'>[what it means]</font> to know <i>and</i> recognize Me? says the Lord.

<p><sup>17</sup> But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness <i>and</i> dishonest gain, for shedding innocent blood, for oppression and doing violence.

<p><sup>18</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: <font color='#7a8080'>[Relatives]</font> shall not lament for him, saying, Ah, my brother! or, Ah, sister, <font color='#7a8080'>[how great our loss! Subjects]</font> shall not lament for him saying, Ah, lord! or Ah, his majesty! <i>or</i> Ah, <font color='#7a8080'>[how great was]</font> his glory!

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[No]</font> he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey—dragged out and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>20</sup> Go up <font color='#7a8080'>[north]</font> to Lebanon and cry out, and raise your voice in <font color='#7a8080'>[the hills]</font> of Bashan <font color='#7a8080'>[across the Jordan]</font>, and cry out from Abarim <font color='#7a8080'>[a range of mountains southeast of Palestine]</font>, for all your lovers (the king's chosen allies) are destroyed.

<p><sup>21</sup> I spoke to you in your <font color='#7a8080'>[times of]</font> prosperity, but you said, I will not listen! This has been your attitude from your youth; you have not obeyed My voice.

<p><sup>22</sup> The wind <font color='#7a8080'>[of adversity]</font> shall pasture upon <i>and</i> consume all your shepherds (your princes and statesmen), and your lovers (allies) shall go into captivity. Surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded <i>and</i> dismayed because of all your wickedness.

<p><sup>23</sup> O inhabitant of Lebanon <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem, whose palaces are made of Lebanon's trees]</font>, you who make your nest among the cedars, how you will groan <i>and</i> how pitiable you will be when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in childbirth!

<p><sup>24</sup> As I live, says the Lord, though Coniah <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Jeconiah and Jehoiachin]</font> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet <font color='#7a8080'>[ring]</font> upon My right hand, yet would I tear you off.

<p><sup>25</sup> And I will give you into the hands of those who seek your life and into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hands of the Chaldeans.

<p><sup>26</sup> And I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you will die.

<p><sup>27</sup> But to the land to which they will yearn to return, there they will not return.

<p><sup>28</sup> Is this man <font color='#7a8080'>[King]</font> Coniah a despised, broken pot? Is he a vessel in which no one takes pleasure? Why are they hurled out, he and his royal offspring, and cast into a land which they do not know, understand, <i>or</i> recognize?

<p><sup>29</sup> O land, land, land, hear the word of the Lord!

<p><sup>30</sup> Thus says the Lord: Write this man <font color='#7a8080'>[Coniah]</font> down as childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days, for no man of his offspring shall succeed in sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.

<h4>23</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to the shepherds (the civil leaders) who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasturing! says the Lord.

<p><sup>2</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for <i>and</i> feed My people: You have scattered My flock and driven them away and have not visited <i>and</i> attended to them; behold, I will visit <i>and</i> attend to you for the evil of your doings, says the Lord.

<p><sup>3</sup> And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries to which I have driven them and will bring them again to their folds <i>and</i> pastures; and they will be fruitful and multiply.

<p><sup>4</sup> And I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. And they will fear no more nor be dismayed, neither will any be missing <i>or</i> lost, says the Lord.

<p><sup>5</sup> Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up to David a righteous Branch (Sprout), and He will reign as King and do wisely and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.

<p><sup>6</sup> In His days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is His name by which He shall be called: The Lord Our Righteousness.

<p><sup>7</sup> Therefore behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when they shall no more say, As the Lord lives, Who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,

<p><sup>8</sup> But, As the Lord lives, Who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel from the north country and from all the countries to which I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land. .

<p><sup>9</sup> Concerning the prophets: My heart <font color='#7a8080'>[says Jeremiah]</font> is broken within me, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, a man whom wine has overcome, because of the Lord and because of His holy words <font color='#7a8080'>[which He has pronounced against unfaithful leaders]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> For the land is full of adulterers (forsakers of God, Israel's true Husband). Because of the curse <font color='#7a8080'>[of God upon it]</font> the land mourns, the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. They <font color='#7a8080'>[both false prophets and people]</font> rush into wickedness; <i>and</i> their course is evil, their might is not right.

<p><sup>11</sup> For both <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophet and priest are ungodly <i>and</i> profane; even in My house have I found their wickedness, says the Lord.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore their way will be to them like slippery paths in the dark; they will be driven on and fall into them. For I will bring evil upon them in the year of their punishment, says the Lord.

<p><sup>13</sup> And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied by Baal and caused My people Israel to err <i>and</i> go astray.

<p><sup>14</sup> I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they encourage <i>and</i> strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none returns from his wickedness. They have all of them become to Me like Sodom, and her inhabitants like Gomorrah.

<p><sup>15</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with <font color='#7a8080'>[the bitterness of]</font> wormwood and make them drink the <font color='#7a8080'>[poisonous]</font> water of gall, for from the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets of Jerusalem profaneness <i>and</i> ungodliness have gone forth into all the land.

<p><sup>16</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets who prophesy to you. They teach you vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility) <i>and</i> fill you with vain hopes; they speak a vision of their own minds and not from the mouth of the Lord.

<p><sup>17</sup> They are continually saying to those who despise Me <i>and</i> the word of the Lord, The Lord has said: You shall have peace; and they say to everyone who walks after the stubbornness of his own mind <i>and</i> heart, No evil shall come upon you.

<p><sup>18</sup> For who among them has stood in the council of the Lord, that he should perceive and hear His word? Who has marked His word <font color='#7a8080'>[noticing and observing and giving attention to it]</font> and has <font color='#7a8080'>[actually]</font> heard it?

<p><sup>19</sup> Behold, the tempest of the Lord has gone forth in wrath, a whirling tempest; it shall whirl <i>and</i> burst upon the heads of the wicked.

<p><sup>20</sup> The anger of the Lord shall not turn back until He has executed <i>and</i> accomplished the thoughts <i>and</i> intents of His mind <i>and</i> heart. In the latter days you shall consider <i>and</i> understand it perfectly.

<p><sup>21</sup> I did not send these <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.

<p><sup>22</sup> But if they had stood in My council, then they would have caused My people to hear My words, then they would have turned them <font color='#7a8080'>[My people]</font> from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.

<p><sup>23</sup> Am I a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off?

<p><sup>24</sup> Can anyone hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the Lord.

<p><sup>25</sup> I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed <font color='#7a8080'>[visions on my bed at night]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[How long shall this state of things continue?]</font> How long yet shall it be in the minds of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even the prophets of the deceit of their own hearts,

<p><sup>27</sup> Who think that they can cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which every man tells to his neighbor, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?

<p><sup>28</sup> The prophet who has a dream, let him tell his dream; but he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat <font color='#7a8080'>[for nourishment]</font>? says the Lord.

<p><sup>29</sup> Is not My word like fire <font color='#7a8080'>[that consumes all that cannot endure the test]</font>? says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks in pieces the rock <font color='#7a8080'>[of most stubborn resistance]</font>?

<p><sup>30</sup> Therefore behold, I am against the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets, says the Lord, <font color='#7a8080'>[I am even now descending upon them with punishment, these prophets]</font> who steal My words from one another <font color='#7a8080'>[imitating the phrases of the true prophets]</font>.

<p><sup>31</sup> Behold, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who use their <font color='#7a8080'>[own deceitful]</font> tongues and say, Thus says the Lord.

<p><sup>32</sup> Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the Lord, and tell them and cause My people to err <i>and</i> go astray by their lies and by their vain boasting <i>and</i> recklessness—when I did not send them or command them; nor do they profit these people at all, says the Lord.

<p><sup>33</sup> And when these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, What is the burden of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[the thing to be lifted up now]</font>? then you shall say to them, What burden <font color='#7a8080'>[indeed]</font>! <font color='#7a8080'>[You are the burden!]</font> And I will disburden Myself of you <i>and</i> I will cast you off, says the Lord.

<p><sup>34</sup> And as for the prophet, the priest, or <font color='#7a8080'>[any of these]</font> the people, whoever <font color='#7a8080'>[in mockery calls the word of the Lord a burden and]</font> says, The burden of the Lord, I will even visit in wrath <i>and</i> punish that man and his house.

<p><sup>35</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[For the future, in speaking of the utterances of the Lord]</font> thus shall you say every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother: What has the Lord answered? or, What has the Lord spoken?

<p><sup>36</sup> But the burden of the Lord you must mention no more, for every man's burden is his own response <i>and</i> word <font color='#7a8080'>[for as they mockingly call all prophecies burdens, whether good or bad, so will it prove to be to them; God will take them at their own word]</font>; for you pervert the words <font color='#7a8080'>[not of a lifeless idol, but]</font> of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God!

<p><sup>37</sup> Thus shall you <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> say to the prophet: What has the Lord answered you? Or, What has the Lord spoken?

<p><sup>38</sup> But if you say, The burden of the Lord, therefore thus says the Lord: Because you said these words, The burden of the Lord, when I sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the Lord,

<p><sup>39</sup> Therefore behold, I, even I, will assuredly take you up and cast you away from My presence, you and the city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> which I gave to you and to your fathers.

<p><sup>40</sup> And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which will not be forgotten.

<h4>24</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> After Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile Jeconiah <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Coniah and Jehoiachin]</font> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed me <font color='#7a8080'>[in a vision]</font> two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord.

<p><sup>2</sup> One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then the Lord said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs—the good figs very good, and the bad very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.

<p><sup>4</sup> Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

<p><sup>5</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.

<p><sup>6</sup> For I will set My eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up.

<p><sup>7</sup> And I will give them a heart to know (recognize, understand, and be acquainted with) Me, that I am the Lord; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart.

<p><sup>8</sup> And as for the bad figs, which are so bad that they cannot be eaten, surely thus says the Lord, So will I give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes and the residue of Jerusalem who remains in this land and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.

<p><sup>9</sup> I will even give them up to be a dismay <i>and</i> a horror <i>and</i> to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach, a byword <i>or</i> proverb, a taunt, and a curse in all places where I will drive them.

<p><sup>10</sup> And I will send the sword, famine, and pestilence among them until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.

<h4>25</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah—which was the first year of the reign of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon—

<p><sup>2</sup> Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:

<p><sup>3</sup> For these twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day—the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you persistently early and late, but you have not listened <i>and</i> obeyed.

<p><sup>4</sup> Although the Lord persistently sent you all the prophets, His servants, yet you have not listened and obeyed or <font color='#7a8080'>[even]</font> inclined your ear to hear.

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The prophets came on My behalf]</font> saying, Turn again now every one from his evil way and wrongdoing; <font color='#7a8080'>[that you may not forfeit the right to]</font> dwell in the land that the Lord gave to you and to your fathers from of old <i>and</i> forevermore.

<p><sup>6</sup> Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.

<p><sup>7</sup> Yet you have not listened to <i>and</i> obeyed Me, says the Lord, that you might provoke Me to anger with the works (idols) made by your hands to your own hurt.

<p><sup>8</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you have not heard <i>and</i> obeyed My words,

<p><sup>9</sup> Behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, says the Lord, and I will send for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant <font color='#7a8080'>[or agent to fulfill My designs]</font>, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will devote them <font color='#7a8080'>[to God]</font> <i>and</i> utterly destroy them and make them an amazement, a hissing, and perpetual <i>and</i> agelong desolations.

<p><sup>10</sup> Moreover, I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones <font color='#7a8080'>[grinding out the meal]</font> and the light of the candle <font color='#7a8080'>[which every home burned throughout the night]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> And this whole land shall be a waste and an astonishment, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.

<p><sup>12</sup> Then when seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, says the Lord, for their iniquity, and will make the land <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Chaldeans]</font> a perpetual waste.

<p><sup>13</sup> And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.

<p><sup>14</sup> For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even them <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldeans who enslaved other nations]</font>; and I will recompense <font color='#7a8080'>[all of]</font> them according to their deeds and according to the work of their <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> hands.

<p><sup>15</sup> For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.

<p><sup>16</sup> They shall drink and reel to and fro and be crazed because of the sword that I will send among them.

<p><sup>17</sup> Then I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> took the cup from the Lord's hand and made all the nations drink it to whom the Lord had sent me: <font color='#7a8080'>[that is,]</font>

<p><sup>18</sup> Jerusalem and the cities of Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[being most guilty because their privileges were greatest]</font>, its kings and princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is to this day;

<p><sup>19</sup> Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, all his people,

<p><sup>20</sup> And all the mixed foreign population; all the kings of the land of Uz; and all the kings of the land of the Philistines and <font color='#7a8080'>[their cities of]</font> Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;

<p><sup>21</sup> Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon;

<p><sup>22</sup> All the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the islands <i>and</i> the coastlands across the <font color='#7a8080'>[Mediterranean]</font> Sea;

<p><sup>23</sup> Dedan, Tema, Buz <font color='#7a8080'>[neighboring tribes north of Arabia]</font>, and all who clip off the corners of their hair <i>and</i> beards;

<p><sup>24</sup> All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed foreign people who dwell in the desert;

<p><sup>25</sup> All the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam (Persia), and all the kings of Media;

<p><sup>26</sup> All the kings of the north, far and near, one after another—and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Sheshach (Babel or Babylon) shall drink.

<p><sup>27</sup> Then you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, be drunk, vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword which I am sending among you.

<p><sup>28</sup> And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord of hosts: You shall surely drink!

<p><sup>29</sup> For behold, I am beginning to work evil in the city which is called by My Name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>30</sup> Therefore prophesy against them all these words and say to them: The Lord shall roar from on high and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He shall roar mightily against His fold <i>and</i> pasture. He shall give a shout like those who tread grapes <font color='#7a8080'>[in the winepress, but His shout will be]</font> against all the inhabitants of the earth.

<p><sup>31</sup> A noise will come even to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has a controversy and an indictment against the nations; He will enter into judgment with all mankind; as for the wicked, He will give them to the sword, says the Lord.

<p><sup>32</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, evil will go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirling tempest will rise from the uttermost parts of the earth.

<p><sup>33</sup> And those slain by the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented or gathered or buried; their <font color='#7a8080'>[dead bodies]</font> shall be dung upon the ground.

<p><sup>34</sup> Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and roll in ashes, you principal ones of the flock. For the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come, and you shall fall <i>and</i> be dashed into pieces like a choice vessel.

<p><sup>35</sup> And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal ones of the flock any means of escape.

<p><sup>36</sup> A voice! The cry of the shepherds and the wailing of the principal ones of the flock! For the Lord is laying waste <i>and</i> destroying their pasture.

<p><sup>37</sup> And the peaceable folds are devastated <i>and</i> brought to silence because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

<p><sup>38</sup> He has left His shelter like the lion; for their land has become a waste <i>and</i> an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord's]</font> fierce anger.

<h4>26</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the Lord:

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord: Stand in the court of the Lord's house <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> and speak to all <font color='#7a8080'>[the people of]</font> the cities of Judah who come to worship in the Lord's house all the words that I command you to speak to them; subtract not a word.

<p><sup>3</sup> It may be that they will listen and turn every man from his evil way, that I may relent <i>and</i> reverse My decision concerning the evil which I purpose to do to them because of their evil doings.

<p><sup>4</sup> And you will say to them, Thus says the Lord: If you will not listen to <i>and</i> obey Me, to walk in My law, which I have set before you,

<p><sup>5</sup> And to hear <i>and</i> obey the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you urgently <i>and</i> persistently—though you have not listened <i>and</i> obeyed—

<p><sup>6</sup> Then will I make this house <font color='#7a8080'>[the temple]</font> like Shiloh <font color='#7a8080'>[the home of the Tent of Meeting, abandoned and later destroyed after the ark was captured by the Philistines]</font>, and I will make this city subject to the curses of all nations of the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[so vile in their sight will it be]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> And the priests and the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>8</sup> Now when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets and all the people seized him, saying, You shall surely die!

<p><sup>9</sup> Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh <font color='#7a8080'>[after the ark of the Lord had been taken by our enemies]</font> and this city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered around Jeremiah in the <font color='#7a8080'>[outer area of the]</font> house of the Lord.

<p><sup>10</sup> When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the Lord and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people, This man is deserving of death, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.

<p><sup>12</sup> Then Jeremiah said to all the princes and to all the people: The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will relent <i>and</i> reverse the decision concerning the evil which He has pronounced against you.

<p><sup>14</sup> As for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as seems good and suitable to you.

<p><sup>15</sup> But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon its inhabitants, for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.

<p><sup>16</sup> Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not deserving of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.

<p><sup>17</sup> Then certain of the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people,

<p><sup>18</sup> Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and said to all the people of Judah, Thus says the Lord of hosts: Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps <font color='#7a8080'>[of ruins]</font>, and the mountain of the house <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Lord—Mount Moriah, on which stands the temple, shall become covered not with buildings, but]</font> like a densely wooded height.

<p><sup>19</sup> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put <font color='#7a8080'>[Micah]</font> to death? Did he not <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fear the Lord and entreat the Lord? And did not the Lord relent <i>and</i> reverse the decision concerning the evil which He had pronounced against them? But <font color='#7a8080'>[here]</font> we are thinking of committing what will be a great evil against ourselves.

<p><sup>20</sup> And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land in words similar to those of Jeremiah.

<p><sup>21</sup> And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put <font color='#7a8080'>[Uriah]</font> to death; but when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.

<p><sup>22</sup> And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan son of Achbor and certain other men <font color='#7a8080'>[who went]</font> with him into Egypt.

<p><sup>23</sup> And they fetched Uriah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who slew him <font color='#7a8080'>[God's spokesman]</font> with the sword and cast his dead body among the graves of the common people.

<p><sup>24</sup> But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that he might not be given into the hands of the people to put him <font color='#7a8080'>[also]</font> to death.

<h4>27</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord to me: Make for yourself thongs and yoke bars and put them on your neck,

<p><sup>3</sup> And send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the Ammonites, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon by the hand of the messengers who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.

<p><sup>4</sup> And command them to say to their masters, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to your masters:

<p><sup>5</sup> I have made the earth, the men, and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I give it to whomever it seems right <i>and</i> suitable to Me.

<p><sup>6</sup> And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant <i>and</i> instrument, and the beasts of the field also I have given him to serve him.

<p><sup>7</sup> And all nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the <font color='#7a8080'>[God-appointed]</font> time <font color='#7a8080'>[of punishment]</font> of his own land comes; and then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.

<p><sup>8</sup> But any nation or kingdom that will not serve this same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, says the Lord, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed it by <font color='#7a8080'>[Nebuchadnezzar's]</font> hand.

<p><sup>9</sup> So do not listen to your <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets, your diviners, your dreamers <font color='#7a8080'>[and your dreams, whether your own or others']</font>, your soothsayers, your sorcerers, who say to you, You shall not serve the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>10</sup> For they prophesy a lie to you which will cause you to be removed far from your land; and I will drive you out, and you will perish.

<p><sup>11</sup> But any nation that brings its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, that nation will I let remain on its own land, says the Lord, to cultivate it and dwell in it.

<p><sup>12</sup> I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah in the same way: Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.

<p><sup>13</sup> Why will you and your people die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?

<p><sup>14</sup> Do not listen to <i>and</i> believe the words of the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets who are saying to you, You shall not serve the king of Babylon, for it is a lie that they prophesy to you.

<p><sup>15</sup> For I have not sent them, says the Lord; but they are prophesying falsely in My name. <font color='#7a8080'>[It will only end when]</font> I will drive you out to perish together with the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets who prophesy to you.

<p><sup>16</sup> Also I said to the priests and to all these people, Thus says the Lord: Do not listen to the words of your <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they are prophesying a lie to you.

<p><sup>17</sup> Do not listen to them <i>or</i> heed them; serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city be laid waste?

<p><sup>18</sup> But if they are true prophets and if the word of the Lord is really spoken by them, let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are <font color='#7a8080'>[still]</font> left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.

<p><sup>19</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the <font color='#7a8080'>[bronze]</font> pillars <font color='#7a8080'>[each twenty-seven feet high]</font>, the <font color='#7a8080'>[bronze]</font> Sea <font color='#7a8080'>[the laver at which the priests cleansed their hands and feet before ministering at the altar]</font>, the <font color='#7a8080'>[bronze]</font> bases <font color='#7a8080'>[of the ten lavers in Solomon's temple used for washing animals to be offered as sacrifices]</font>, and the remainder of the vessels which are left in this city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>,

<p><sup>20</sup> Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Coniah and Jehoiachin]</font> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—

<p><sup>21</sup> Yes, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels which <font color='#7a8080'>[still]</font> remain in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:

<p><sup>22</sup> They will be carried to Babylon and there will they be until the day that I visit them <font color='#7a8080'>[with My favor]</font>, says the Lord. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.

<h4>28</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In that same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year and the fifth month, Hananiah son of Azzur, the <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophet, who was from Gibeon <font color='#7a8080'>[one of the priests' cities]</font>, said <font color='#7a8080'>[falsely]</font> to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people:

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>3</sup> Within two <font color='#7a8080'>[full]</font> years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.

<p><sup>4</sup> And I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Coniah and Jehoiachin]</font> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, says the Lord, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who stood in the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> The prophet Jeremiah said, Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord perform your words which you have prophesied to bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the Lord's house and all who were carried away captive.

<p><sup>7</sup> Nevertheless, listen now to <i>and</i> hear this word which I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:

<p><sup>8</sup> The prophets who were before me and before you from of old prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence.

<p><sup>9</sup> But as for the prophet who <font color='#7a8080'>[on the contrary]</font> prophesies of peace, when that prophet's word comes to pass, <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> then will it be known that the Lord has truly sent him.

<p><sup>10</sup> Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke bar off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and smashed it.

<p><sup>11</sup> And Hananiah said in the presence of all the people, Thus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke bars of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within the space of two <font color='#7a8080'>[full]</font> years. But the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

<p><sup>12</sup> The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet <font color='#7a8080'>[some time]</font> after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah:

<p><sup>13</sup> Go, tell Hananiah, Thus says the Lord: You have broken yoke bars of wood, but you have made in their stead bars of iron.

<p><sup>14</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations the iron yoke of servitude of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him. For I have given him even the beasts of the field.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Listen now, Hananiah, The Lord has not sent you, but you have made this people trust in a lie.

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will cast you from the face of the earth. This year you will die, because you have uttered <i>and</i> taught rebellion against the Lord.

<p><sup>17</sup> So Hananiah the prophet died <font color='#7a8080'>[two months later]</font>, the same year, in the seventh month.

<h4>29</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders in exile and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.

<p><sup>2</sup> This was after King Jeconiah <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Coniah and Jehoiachin]</font> and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The letter was sent]</font> by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:

<p><sup>4</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:

<p><sup>5</sup> Build yourselves houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat the fruit of them.

<p><sup>6</sup> Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not be diminished.

<p><sup>7</sup> And seek (inquire for, require, and request) the peace <i>and</i> welfare of the city to which I have caused you to be carried away captive; and pray to the Lord for it, for in the welfare of <font color='#7a8080'>[the city in which you live]</font> you will have welfare.

<p><sup>8</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your <font color='#7a8080'>[false]</font> prophets and your diviners who are in your midst deceive you; pay no attention <i>and</i> attach no significance to your dreams which you dream <i>or</i> to theirs,

<p><sup>9</sup> For they prophesy falsely to you in My name. I have not sent them, says the Lord.

<p><sup>10</sup> For thus says the Lord, When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you and keep My good promise to you, causing you to return to this place.

<p><sup>11</sup> For I know the thoughts <i>and</i> plans that I have for you, says the Lord, thoughts <i>and</i> plans for welfare <i>and</i> peace and not for evil, to give you hope in your final outcome.

<p><sup>12</sup> Then you will call upon Me, and you will come and pray to Me, and I will hear <i>and</i> heed you.

<p><sup>13</sup> Then you will seek Me, inquire for, <i>and</i> require Me <font color='#7a8080'>[as a vital necessity]</font> and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.

<p><sup>14</sup> I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will release you from captivity and gather you from all the nations and all the places to which I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will bring you back to the place from which I caused you to be carried away captive.

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But as for those still in Jerusalem]</font> because you have said, The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,

<p><sup>16</sup> Thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits upon the throne of David and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brethren who did not go forth with you into captivity—

<p><sup>17</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I am sending on them the sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs which are so bad they cannot be eaten.

<p><sup>18</sup> And I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and pestilence and will give them up to be tossed to and fro <i>and</i> to be a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, an astonishment, <i>and</i> a terror, a hissing and a reproach among all the nations to which I have driven them,

<p><sup>19</sup> Because they have not listened to <i>and</i> heeded My words, says the Lord, which I sent to them persistently by My servants the prophets; but you <font color='#7a8080'>[exiles]</font> would not listen <font color='#7a8080'>[either]</font>, says the Lord.

<p><sup>20</sup> Hear therefore the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.

<p><sup>21</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he will slay them <font color='#7a8080'>[those false prophets whom you say I have raised up for you in Babylon]</font> before your eyes!

<p><sup>22</sup> And because of them, this curse shall be taken up <i>and</i> used by all from Judah who are in captivity in Babylon: The Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire—

<p><sup>23</sup> Because they have committed folly in Israel and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I had not commanded them. I am the One Who knows and I am witness, says the Lord.

<p><sup>24</sup> Also you shall say this concerning <i>and</i> to Shemaiah of Nehelam <font color='#7a8080'>[among the exiles in Babylon]</font>:

<p><sup>25</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have sent letters in your <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> name to all the people who are in Jerusalem and to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest and to all the priests, saying,

<p><sup>26</sup> The Lord has made you <font color='#7a8080'>[Zephaniah]</font> priest instead of Jehoiada the <font color='#7a8080'>[deputy]</font> priest, that you should have oversight in the house of the Lord over every madman who makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and collar.

<p><sup>27</sup> Now therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[continued the letter from Shemaiah in Babylon to Zephaniah in Jerusalem]</font>, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you?

<p><sup>28</sup> For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, <font color='#7a8080'>[This captivity of yours]</font> is to be long; build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat the fruit of them.

<p><sup>29</sup> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.

<p><sup>30</sup> Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah:

<p><sup>31</sup> Send <font color='#7a8080'>[this message]</font> to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has caused you to trust in a lie,

<p><sup>32</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his offspring. He will not have anyone <font color='#7a8080'>[born]</font> to dwell among this people, nor will he see the good that I will do to My people, says the Lord, because he has spoken <i>and</i> taught rebellion against the Lord.

<h4>30</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.

<p><sup>3</sup> For, note well, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will release from captivity My people Israel and Judah, says the Lord, and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.

<p><sup>4</sup> And these are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah:

<p><sup>5</sup> Thus says the Lord: We have heard a voice of trembling <i>and</i> panic—of terror, and not peace.

<p><sup>6</sup> Ask now and see whether a man can give birth to a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor? Why are all faces turned pale?

<p><sup>7</sup> Alas! for that day will be great, so that none will be like it; it will be the time of Jacob's <font color='#7a8080'>[unequaled]</font> trouble, but he will be saved out of it.

<p><sup>8</sup> For it will come to pass in that day, says the Lord of hosts, that I will break <font color='#7a8080'>[the oppressor's]</font> yoke from your neck, and I will burst your bonds; and strangers will no more make slaves of <font color='#7a8080'>[the people of Israel]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> But they will serve the Lord their God and David's <font color='#7a8080'>[descendant]</font> their King, Whom I will raise up for them.

<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore fear not, O My servant Jacob, says the Lord, nor be dismayed <i>or</i> cast down, O Israel; for behold, I will save you out of a distant land <font color='#7a8080'>[of exile]</font> and your posterity from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, and none will make him afraid <i>or</i> cause him to be terrorized <i>and</i> to tremble.

<p><sup>11</sup> For I am with you, says the Lord, to save you; for I will make a full <i>and</i> complete end of all the nations to which I have scattered you, but I will not make a full <i>and</i> complete end of you. But I will correct you in measure <i>and</i> with judgment and will in no sense hold you guiltless <i>or</i> leave you unpunished.

<p><sup>12</sup> For thus says the Lord: Your hurt is incurable and your wound is grievous.

<p><sup>13</sup> There is none to plead your cause; for <font color='#7a8080'>[the pressing together of]</font> your wound you have no healing <font color='#7a8080'>[device]</font>, no binding plaster.

<p><sup>14</sup> All your lovers (allies) have forgotten you; they neither seek, inquire of, <i>or</i> require you. For I have hurt you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel <i>and</i> merciless foe, because of the greatness of your perversity <i>and</i> guilt, because your sins are glaring <i>and</i> innumerable.

<p><sup>15</sup> Why do you cry out because of your hurt <font color='#7a8080'>[the natural result of your sins]</font>? Your pain is deadly (incurable). Because of the greatness of your perversity <i>and</i> guilt, because your sins are glaring <i>and</i> innumerable, I have done these things to you.

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore all who devour you will be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity. And they who despoil you will become a spoil, and all who prey upon you will I give for a prey.

<p><sup>17</sup> For I will restore health to you, and I will heal your wounds, says the Lord, because they have called you an outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no one seeks after <i>and</i> for whom no one cares!

<p><sup>18</sup> Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will release from captivity the tents of Jacob and have mercy on his dwelling places; the city will be rebuilt on its own <font color='#7a8080'>[old]</font> moundlike site, and the palace will be dwelt in after its former fashion.

<p><sup>19</sup> Out of them <font color='#7a8080'>[city and palace]</font> will come songs of thanksgiving and the voices of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they will not be few; I will also glorify them, and they will not be small.

<p><sup>20</sup> Their children too shall be as in former times, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all who oppress them.

<p><sup>21</sup> And their prince will be one of them, and their ruler will come from the midst of them. I will cause him to draw near and he will approach Me, for who is he who would have the boldness <i>and</i> would dare <font color='#7a8080'>[on his own initiative]</font> to approach Me? says the Lord.

<p><sup>22</sup> Then you will be My people, and I will be your God.

<p><sup>23</sup> Behold, the tempest of the Lord has gone forth with wrath, a sweeping <i>and</i> gathering tempest; it shall whirl <i>and</i> burst upon the heads of the wicked.

<p><sup>24</sup> The fierce anger <i>and</i> indignation of the Lord shall not turn back until He has executed <i>and</i> accomplished the thoughts <i>and</i> intents of His mind <i>and</i> heart. In the latter days you shall understand this.

<h4>31</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> At that time, says the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be My people.

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord: The people who survived the sword found favor in the wilderness <font color='#7a8080'>[place of exile]</font>—when Israel sought to find rest.

<p><sup>3</sup> The Lord appeared from of old to me <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn you <i>and</i> continued My faithfulness to you.

<p><sup>4</sup> Again I will build you and you will be built, O Virgin Israel! You will again be adorned with your timbrels <font color='#7a8080'>[small one-headed drums]</font> and go forth in the dancing <font color='#7a8080'>[chorus]</font> of those who make merry.

<p><sup>5</sup> Again you shall plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant and make the fruit common <i>and</i> enjoy it <font color='#7a8080'>[undisturbed]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> For there shall be a day when the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry out, Arise, and let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God.

<p><sup>7</sup> For thus says the Lord: Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the head of the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[on account of the chosen people, Israel]</font>. Proclaim, praise, and say, The Lord has saved His people, the remnant of Israel!

<p><sup>8</sup> Behold, I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, and among them will be the blind and the lame, the woman with child and she who labors in childbirth together; a great company, they will return here to Jerusalem.

<p><sup>9</sup> They will come with weeping <font color='#7a8080'>[in penitence and for joy]</font>, pouring out prayers <font color='#7a8080'>[for the future]</font>. I will lead them back; I will cause them to walk by streams of water and bring them in a straight way in which they will not stumble, for I am a Father to Israel, and Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> is My firstborn.

<p><sup>10</sup> Hear the word of the Lord, O you nations, and declare it in the isles <i>and</i> coastlands far away, and say, He Who scattered Israel will gather him and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.

<p><sup>11</sup> For the Lord has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from the hand of him who was too strong for him.

<p><sup>12</sup> They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion and shall flow together <i>and</i> be radiant with joy over the goodness of the Lord—for the corn, for the juice <font color='#7a8080'>[of the grape]</font>, for the oil, and for the young of the flock and the herd. And their life shall be like a watered garden, and they shall not sorrow <i>or</i> languish any more at all.

<p><sup>13</sup> Then will the maidens rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old together. For I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice after their sorrow.

<p><sup>14</sup> I will satisfy fully the life of the priests with abundance <font color='#7a8080'>[of offerings shared with them]</font>, and My people will be satisfied with My goodness, says the Lord.

<p><sup>15</sup> Thus says the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.

<p><sup>16</sup> Thus says the Lord: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work shall be rewarded, says the Lord; and <font color='#7a8080'>[your children]</font> shall return from the enemy's land.

<p><sup>17</sup> And there is hope for your future, says the Lord; your children shall come back to their own country.

<p><sup>18</sup> I have surely heard Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> moaning thus: You have chastised me, and I was chastised, like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; bring me back, that I may be restored, for You are the Lord my God.

<p><sup>19</sup> Surely after I <font color='#7a8080'>[Ephraim]</font> was turned <font color='#7a8080'>[from You]</font>, I repented; and after I was instructed, I penitently smote my thigh. I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I bore the disgrace of my youth <font color='#7a8080'>[as a nation]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a darling child <i>and</i> beloved? For as often as I speak against him, I do <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember him still. Therefore My affection is stirred <i>and</i> My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy, pity, <i>and</i> loving-kindness for him, says the Lord.

<p><sup>21</sup> Set up for yourselves highway markers <font color='#7a8080'>[back to Canaan]</font>, make for yourselves guideposts; turn your thoughts <i>and</i> attention to the way by which you went <font color='#7a8080'>[into exile]</font>. Retrace your steps, O Virgin Israel, return to these your cities.

<p><sup>22</sup> How long will you waver <i>and</i> hesitate <font color='#7a8080'>[to return]</font>, O you backsliding daughter? For the Lord has created a new thing in the land <font color='#7a8080'>[of Israel]</font>: a female shall compass (woo, win, and protect) a man.

<p><sup>23</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in her cities when I release them from exile: The Lord bless you, O habitation of justice <i>and</i> righteousness, O holy mountain!

<p><sup>24</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[the people of]</font> Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together—<font color='#7a8080'>[nomad]</font> farmers and those who wander about with their flocks.

<p><sup>25</sup> For I will <font color='#7a8080'>[fully]</font> satisfy the weary soul, and I will replenish every languishing <i>and</i> sorrowful person.

<p><sup>26</sup> Thereupon I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> awoke and looked, and my <font color='#7a8080'>[trancelike]</font> sleep was sweet <font color='#7a8080'>[in the assurance it gave]</font> to me.

<p><sup>27</sup> Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed (offspring) of man and of beast.

<p><sup>28</sup> And it will be that as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to overthrow, destroy, and afflict <font color='#7a8080'>[with evil]</font>, so will I watch over them to build and to plant <font color='#7a8080'>[with good]</font>, says the Lord.

<p><sup>29</sup> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.

<p><sup>30</sup> But everyone shall die for his own iniquity <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font>; every man who eats sour grapes—his <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> teeth shall be set on edge.

<p><sup>31</sup> Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,

<p><sup>32</sup> Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband, says the Lord.

<p><sup>33</sup> But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, says the Lord, I will put My law within them, and on their hearts will I write it; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.

<p><sup>34</sup> And they will no more teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they will all know Me <font color='#7a8080'>[recognize, understand, and be acquainted with Me]</font>, from the least of them to the greatest, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember their sin no more.

<p><sup>35</sup> Thus says the Lord, Who gives the sun for a light by day and the fixed order of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, Who stirs up the sea's roaring billows <i>or</i> stills the waves when they roar—the Lord of hosts is His name:

<p><sup>36</sup> If these ordinances <font color='#7a8080'>[of fixed order]</font> depart from before Me, says the Lord, then the posterity of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me throughout the ages.

<p><sup>37</sup> Thus says the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, says the Lord.

<p><sup>38</sup> Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when the city <font color='#7a8080'>[of Jerusalem]</font> shall be built <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font> for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.

<p><sup>39</sup> And the measuring line shall go out farther straight onward to the hill Gareb and shall then turn to Goah <font color='#7a8080'>[exact location unknown]</font>.

<p><sup>40</sup> And the whole valley <font color='#7a8080'>[Hinnom]</font> of the dead bodies and <font color='#7a8080'>[the hill]</font> of the ashes <font color='#7a8080'>[long dumped there from the temple sacrifices]</font>, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the Lord. It <font color='#7a8080'>[the city]</font> shall not be plucked up or overthrown any more to the end of the age.

<h4>32</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.

<p><sup>2</sup> For the king of Babylon's army was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah.

<p><sup>3</sup> For Zedekiah king of Judah had locked him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;

<p><sup>4</sup> And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hands of the Chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;

<p><sup>5</sup> And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him <font color='#7a8080'>[for evil]</font>, says the Lord; and though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper <font color='#7a8080'>[why do you thus prophesy]</font>?

<p><sup>6</sup> And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,

<p><sup>7</sup> Behold, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you and say, Buy my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.

<p><sup>8</sup> So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard in accordance with the word of the Lord, and he said to me, I pray you, buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin, for the right of inheritance is yours and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord.

<p><sup>9</sup> And I bought the field that was in Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son and weighed out for him the money—seventeen shekels of silver.

<p><sup>10</sup> And I signed the deed and sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed out for him the money on the scales.

<p><sup>11</sup> So I took the deed of the purchase—both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and the copy which was unsealed—

<p><sup>12</sup> And I gave the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's son and the witnesses who signed the purchase deed, in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.

<p><sup>13</sup> And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

<p><sup>14</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this purchase deed which is sealed and this unsealed deed, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last a long time.

<p><sup>15</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be purchased yet again in this land.

<p><sup>16</sup> Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord, saying:

<p><sup>17</sup> Alas, Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! There is nothing too hard <i>or</i> too wonderful for You—

<p><sup>18</sup> You Who show loving-kindness to thousands but recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them. The great, the mighty God; the Lord of hosts is His name—

<p><sup>19</sup> Great <font color='#7a8080'>[are You]</font> in counsel and mighty in deeds, Whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to reward <i>or</i> repay each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings,

<p><sup>20</sup> Who wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day <font color='#7a8080'>[continues to do so]</font>, both in Israel and among other men, and made for Yourself a name, as at this day.

<p><sup>21</sup> And You brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm and with great terror;

<p><sup>22</sup> And You gave them this land which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

<p><sup>23</sup> And they entered and took possession of it, but they obeyed not Your voice, nor walked in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do. Therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.

<p><sup>24</sup> See the siege mounds <font color='#7a8080'>[of earth which the foe has heaped against the walls]</font>; they have come up to the city to take it. And the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because <font color='#7a8080'>[the people are overcome]</font> by the sword and the famine and the pestilence. What You have spoken has come to pass, and behold, You see it.

<p><sup>25</sup> Yet, O Lord God, You said to me, Buy the field with money and get witnesses, even though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.

<p><sup>26</sup> Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, saying,

<p><sup>27</sup> Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is there anything too hard for Me?

<p><sup>28</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it;

<p><sup>29</sup> And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come in and set this city on fire and burn it, along with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to provoke Me to anger.

<p><sup>30</sup> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands <font color='#7a8080'>[the idols]</font>, says the Lord.

<p><sup>31</sup> For this city has been to Me a <font color='#7a8080'>[such a]</font> provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they <font color='#7a8080'>[finished]</font> building it <font color='#7a8080'>[in the time of Solomon, who was the first Israelite king who turned to idolatry]</font> even to this day that I must remove it from before My face—

<p><sup>32</sup> Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>33</sup> And they have turned their backs to Me and not their faces; though I taught them persistently, yet they would not listen and receive instruction.

<p><sup>34</sup> But they set their abominations <font color='#7a8080'>[of idol worship]</font> in the house which is called by My Name to defile it.

<p><sup>35</sup> And they built the high places <font color='#7a8080'>[for worship]</font> of Baal in the Valley of Ben-hinnom <font color='#7a8080'>[son of Hinnom]</font> to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire <font color='#7a8080'>[in worship also of and]</font> to Molech—which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind <i>or</i> heart that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

<p><sup>36</sup> And now therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and by famine and by pestilence:

<p><sup>37</sup> Behold, I will gather them out of all countries to which I drove them in My anger and in My wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them again to this place, and I will make them dwell safely.

<p><sup>38</sup> And they will be My people, and I will be their God.

<p><sup>39</sup> And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fear Me forever for the good of themselves and of their children after them.

<p><sup>40</sup> And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will not turn away from following them to do them good, and I will put My <font color='#7a8080'>[reverential]</font> fear in their hearts, so that they will not depart from Me.

<p><sup>41</sup> Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly <i>and</i> in truth with My whole heart and with My whole being.

<p><sup>42</sup> For thus says the Lord: As I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.

<p><sup>43</sup> And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.

<p><sup>44</sup> Men shall buy fields for money and shall sign deeds, seal them, and call witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South (the Negeb), for I will cause them to be released from their exile, says the Lord.

<h4>33</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Moreover, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord Who made <font color='#7a8080'>[the earth]</font>, the Lord Who formed it to establish it—the Lord is His name:

<p><sup>3</sup> Call to Me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things, fenced in <i>and</i> hidden, which you do not know (do not distinguish and recognize, have knowledge of and understand).

<p><sup>4</sup> For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah which are torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and before the sword:

<p><sup>5</sup> They <font color='#7a8080'>[the besieged Jews]</font> are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans, and they <font color='#7a8080'>[the houses]</font> will be filled with the dead bodies of men whom I shall slay in My anger and My wrath; for I have hidden My face <font color='#7a8080'>[in indignation]</font> from this city because of all their wickedness.

<p><sup>6</sup> Behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[in the future restored Jerusalem]</font> I will lay upon it health and healing, and I will cure them and will reveal to them the abundance of peace (prosperity, security, stability) and truth.

<p><sup>7</sup> And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to be reversed and will rebuild them as they were at first.

<p><sup>8</sup> And I will cleanse them from all the guilt <i>and</i> iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will forgive all their guilt <i>and</i> iniquities by which they have sinned and rebelled against Me.

<p><sup>9</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth that hear of all the good I do for it, and they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace, prosperity, security, <i>and</i> stability I provide for it.

<p><sup>10</sup> Thus says the Lord: Yet again there shall be heard in this place of which you say, It is a desolate waste, without man and without beast—even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast—

<p><sup>11</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[There shall be heard again]</font> the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing as they bring sacrifices of thanksgiving into the house of the Lord, Give praise <i>and</i> thanks to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good; for His mercy <i>and</i> kindness <i>and</i> steadfast love endure forever! For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed <i>and</i> return to be as it was at first, says the Lord.

<p><sup>12</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this place which is desolate, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall again be dwellings <i>and</i> pastures of shepherds resting their flocks.

<p><sup>13</sup> In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South (the Negeb), in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah shall flocks pass again under the hands of him who counts them, says the Lord.

<p><sup>14</sup> Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will fulfill the good promise I have made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

<p><sup>15</sup> In those days and at that time will I cause a righteous Branch <font color='#7a8080'>[the Messiah]</font> to grow up to David; and He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.

<p><sup>16</sup> In those days Judah shall be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name by which it will be called, The Lord is Our Righteousness (our Rightness, our Justice).

<p><sup>17</sup> For thus says the Lord: David shall never fail <font color='#7a8080'>[to have]</font> a man <font color='#7a8080'>[descendant]</font> to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,

<p><sup>18</sup> Nor shall the Levitical priests fail <font color='#7a8080'>[to have]</font> a man <font color='#7a8080'>[descendant]</font> to offer burnt offerings before Me and to burn cereal offerings and to make sacrifices continually (all day long).

<p><sup>19</sup> And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

<p><sup>20</sup> Thus says the Lord: If you can break My covenant with the day, and My covenant with the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,

<p><sup>21</sup> Then can also My covenant be broken with David My servant, so that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne, and <font color='#7a8080'>[My league be broken also]</font> with the Levitical priests, My ministers.

<p><sup>22</sup> As the host of <font color='#7a8080'>[the stars of]</font> the heavens cannot be numbered nor the sand of the sea be measured, so will I multiply the offspring of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.

<p><sup>23</sup> Moreover, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

<p><sup>24</sup> Have you not noticed that these people <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jews]</font> are saying, The Lord has cast off the two families <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel and Judah]</font> which He chose? Thus My people have despised <font color='#7a8080'>[themselves in relation to God as His covenant people]</font>, so that they are no more a nation in their <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> sight.

<p><sup>25</sup> Thus says the Lord: If My covenant with day and night does not stand, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[the whole order of nature]</font>,

<p><sup>26</sup> Then will I also cast away the descendants of Jacob and David My servant and will not choose one of his offspring to be ruler over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captivity to be reversed, and I will have mercy, kindness, <i>and</i> steadfast love on <i>and</i> for them.

<h4>34</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the people were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.

<p><sup>3</sup> And you will not escape out of his hand but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand; you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face; and you will go to Babylon.

<p><sup>4</sup> Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the Lord concerning you: You shall not die by the sword;

<p><sup>5</sup> But you shall die in peace. And as with the burnings of <font color='#7a8080'>[spices and perfumes on wood that were granted as suitable for and in honor of]</font> your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so shall a burning be made for you; and <font color='#7a8080'>[people]</font> shall lament for you, saying, Alas, lord! For I have spoken the word, says the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,

<p><sup>7</sup> When the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities remaining of the cities of Judah.

<p><sup>8</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[This is]</font> the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them:

<p><sup>9</sup> Every man should let his Hebrew slaves, male and female, go free, so that no one should make a slave of a Jew, his brother.

<p><sup>10</sup> And all the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant that everyone would let his manservant and his maidservant go free, so that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go.

<p><sup>11</sup> But afterward they turned around and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return <font color='#7a8080'>[to their former masters]</font> and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

<p><sup>13</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,

<p><sup>14</sup> At the end of seven years you shall let every man his brother who is a Hebrew go free who has sold himself <i>or</i> has been sold to you and has served you six years; but your fathers did not listen to <i>and</i> obey Me or incline their ear <font color='#7a8080'>[submitting and consenting to Me]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> And you recently turned around <i>and</i> repented, doing what was right in My sight by proclaiming liberty each one to his neighbor <font color='#7a8080'>[who was his bond servant]</font>; and you made a covenant <i>or</i> pledge before Me in the house which is called by My Name.

<p><sup>16</sup> But then you turned around and defiled My name; each of you caused to return to you your servants, male and female, whom you had set free as they might desire; and you brought them into subjection again to be your slaves.

<p><sup>17</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: You have not listened to Me <i>and</i> obeyed Me in proclaiming liberty each one to his brother and neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you liberty—to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, says the Lord; and I will make you to be tossed to and fro <i>and</i> to be a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth!

<p><sup>18</sup> And the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not kept the terms of the covenant <i>or</i> solemn pledge which they had made before Me, I will make them <font color='#7a8080'>[like]</font> the <font color='#7a8080'>[sacrificial]</font> calf which they cut in two and then passed between its separated parts <font color='#7a8080'>[solemnizing their pledge to Me]</font>—I will make those men the calf!

<p><sup>19</sup> The princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf,

<p><sup>20</sup> I will give them into the hands of their enemies and into the hands of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth.

<p><sup>21</sup> And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hands of their enemies and into the hands of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army which has withdrawn from you.

<p><sup>22</sup> Behold, I will command, says the Lord, and cause them <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldeans]</font> to return to this city; and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.

<h4>35</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:

<p><sup>2</sup> Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then give them <font color='#7a8080'>[who are pledged to drink no wine]</font> some wine to drink.

<p><sup>3</sup> So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,

<p><sup>4</sup> And I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the keeper of the door.

<p><sup>5</sup> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink wine.

<p><sup>6</sup> But they said, We will drink no wine, for Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, commanded us: You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons, forever.

<p><sup>7</sup> Neither shall you build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard or have them; but you shall dwell all your days in tents, that you may live many days in the land where you are temporary residents.

<p><sup>8</sup> And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days—we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters—

<p><sup>9</sup> And not to build ourselves houses to live in; nor do we have vineyard or field or seed.

<p><sup>10</sup> But we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our ancestor commanded us.

<p><sup>11</sup> But when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians. So we are living in Jerusalem.

<p><sup>12</sup> Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah:

<p><sup>13</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to My words <i>and</i> obey them? says the Lord.

<p><sup>14</sup> The command which Jonadab son of Rechab gave to his sons not to drink wine, has been carried out <i>and</i> established <font color='#7a8080'>[as a custom for more than two hundred years]</font>. To this day they drink no wine, but they have obeyed their father's command. But I, even I, have persistently spoken to you, but you have not listened to <i>and</i> obeyed Me.

<p><sup>15</sup> I have sent also to you all My servants the prophets earnestly <i>and</i> persistently, saying, Return now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them; and then you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you did not submit <i>and</i> consent to Me or listen to <i>and</i> obey Me.

<p><sup>16</sup> Since the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have fulfilled <i>and</i> established the command of their father which he commanded them, but these people have not listened to and obeyed Me,

<p><sup>17</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, but they have not listened, and I have called to them, but they have not answered.

<p><sup>18</sup> And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and have kept all his precepts and have done according to all that he commanded you,

<p><sup>19</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab son of Rechab shall never fail <font color='#7a8080'>[to have]</font> a man <font color='#7a8080'>[descendant]</font> to stand before Me.

<h4>36</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:

<p><sup>2</sup> Take a scroll <font color='#7a8080'>[of parchment]</font> for a book and write on it all the words I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations from the day I spoke to you in the days of <font color='#7a8080'>[King]</font> Josiah until this day.

<p><sup>3</sup> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them, so that each one may turn from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote upon the scroll of the book all the words which Jeremiah dictated, <font color='#7a8080'>[words]</font> that the Lord had spoken to him.

<p><sup>5</sup> And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am <font color='#7a8080'>[in hiding, virtually]</font> restrained <i>and</i> shut up; I cannot go into the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore you go, and on a day of fasting, in the hearing of all the people in the Lord's house, you shall read the words of the Lord which you have written on the scroll at my dictation. Also you shall read them in the hearing of all who come out of the cities of Judah.

<p><sup>7</sup> It may be that they will make their supplication <font color='#7a8080'>[for mercy]</font> before the Lord, and each one will turn back from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the Lord has pronounced against this people.

<p><sup>8</sup> And Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah's]</font> book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.

<p><sup>9</sup> And in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, a fast was proclaimed before the Lord for all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came to Jerusalem from the cities of Judah.

<p><sup>10</sup> Then Baruch read in the hearing of all the people the words of Jeremiah from the scroll of the book in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord's house.

<p><sup>11</sup> When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord,

<p><sup>12</sup> He went down to the king's house into the scribe's chamber, and behold, all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the <font color='#7a8080'>[other]</font> princes.

<p><sup>13</sup> Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people and come <font color='#7a8080'>[to us]</font>. So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.

<p><sup>15</sup> And they said to him, Sit down now and read it in our hearing. So Baruch read it in their hearing.

<p><sup>16</sup> Now when they had heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear and said to Baruch, We must surely tell the king of all these words.

<p><sup>17</sup> And they asked Baruch, Tell us now, how did you write all these words? At <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah's]</font> dictation?

<p><sup>18</sup> Then Baruch answered them, He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

<p><sup>19</sup> Then the princes said to Baruch, Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.

<p><sup>20</sup> Then they went into the court to the king, but they <font color='#7a8080'>[first]</font> put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; then they reported all the words to the king.

<p><sup>21</sup> So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and of all the princes who stood beside the king.

<p><sup>22</sup> Now it was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and a fire was burning there before him in the brazier.

<p><sup>23</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[each time]</font> when Jehudi had read three or four columns <font color='#7a8080'>[of the scroll]</font>, he <font color='#7a8080'>[King Jehoiakim]</font> would cut them off with a penknife and cast them into the fire that was in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.

<p><sup>24</sup> Yet they were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments—neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words.

<p><sup>25</sup> Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah tried to persuade the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.

<p><sup>26</sup> And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the Lord hid them.

<p><sup>27</sup> Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch wrote at the dictation of Jeremiah, <font color='#7a8080'>[and the Lord]</font> said:

<p><sup>28</sup> Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.

<p><sup>29</sup> And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus says the Lord: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon shall surely come and destroy this land and shall cut off man and beast from it?

<p><sup>30</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no <font color='#7a8080'>[heir]</font> to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night.

<p><sup>31</sup> And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them—but they would not hear.

<p><sup>32</sup> Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and besides them many similar words were added.

<h4>37</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And Zedekiah son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Jeconiah and Jehoiachin]</font> son of Jehoiakim.

<p><sup>2</sup> But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to <i>and</i> obeyed the words of the Lord which He spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.

<p><sup>3</sup> Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah with Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the Lord our God for us.

<p><sup>4</sup> Now Jeremiah was coming in and going out among the people, for they had not <font color='#7a8080'>[yet]</font> put him in prison.

<p><sup>5</sup> And Pharaoh's army had come forth out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem <i>and</i> departed.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then came the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah:

<p><sup>7</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, will return to Egypt, to their own land.

<p><sup>8</sup> And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city, and they shall take it and burn it with fire.

<p><sup>9</sup> Thus says the Lord: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely stay away from us—for they will not stay away.

<p><sup>10</sup> For though you should defeat the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only the wounded <i>and</i> men stricken through among them, every man confined to his tent, yet they would rise up and burn this city with fire.

<p><sup>11</sup> And when the army of the Chaldeans had departed from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's approaching army,

<p><sup>12</sup> Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin <font color='#7a8080'>[to slip away during the brief lull in the Chaldean invasion]</font> to receive <font color='#7a8080'>[the title to]</font> his portion <font color='#7a8080'>[of land, which the Lord had promised would eventually be valuable]</font> there among the people.

<p><sup>13</sup> And when he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a sentry was <font color='#7a8080'>[on guard]</font> there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are deserting to the Chaldeans.

<p><sup>14</sup> Then said Jeremiah, It is false! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans. But the sentry would not listen to him. So Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.

<p><sup>15</sup> Therefore the princes were enraged with Jeremiah and beat him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe—for they had made that the prison.

<p><sup>16</sup> When Jeremiah had come into the cells in the dungeon and had remained there many days,

<p><sup>17</sup> Zedekiah the king sent and brought him out; and the king asked him secretly in his house, Is there any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah said, There is! And he said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>18</sup> Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, In what have I sinned against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison?

<p><sup>19</sup> Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you or against this land?

<p><sup>20</sup> Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king. Let my supplication, I pray you, come before you <i>and</i> be acceptable, that you do not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.

<p><sup>21</sup> Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard, and a round loaf of bread from the bakers' street was given to him daily until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained <font color='#7a8080'>[imprisoned]</font> in the court of the guard.

<h4>38</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Jehucal]</font> son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord: He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as his only booty <font color='#7a8080'>[as a prize of war]</font>, and he shall live.

<p><sup>3</sup> Thus says the Lord: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.

<p><sup>4</sup> Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech you, let this man <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> be put to death; for <font color='#7a8080'>[talking]</font> thus he weakens the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of these people, but <font color='#7a8080'>[to do them]</font> harm.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hands; for the king is in no position to do anything against you.

<p><sup>6</sup> So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit <font color='#7a8080'>[in the charge]</font> of Malchiah the king's son, which was in the court of the guard; and they let Jeremiah down <font color='#7a8080'>[into the pit]</font> with ropes. And in the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit there was no water, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.

<p><sup>7</sup> Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian <font color='#7a8080'>[a Cushite]</font>, one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit; and while the king was then sitting in the Gate of Benjamin,

<p><sup>8</sup> Ebed-melech went out of the king's house and spoke to the king, saying,

<p><sup>9</sup> My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit; and he is liable to die of hunger <i>and</i> is <font color='#7a8080'>[as good as]</font> dead in the place where he is, for there is no more bread left in the city.

<p><sup>10</sup> Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you and raise Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit before he dies.

<p><sup>11</sup> So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king <font color='#7a8080'>[to a room]</font> under the treasury, and took along from there old rags and worn-out garments and let them down by ropes into the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit to Jeremiah.

<p><sup>12</sup> And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these old rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.

<p><sup>13</sup> So they drew up Jeremiah with the ropes and took him up out of the dungeon <i>or</i> cistern pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

<p><sup>14</sup> Then Zedekiah the king sent and brought Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entrance that is in the house of the Lord. And the king said to Jeremiah, I am going to ask you something; hide nothing from me.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.

<p><sup>16</sup> So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, As the Lord lives, Who made our lives, I will not put you to death or give you into the hands of these men who seek your life.

<p><sup>17</sup> Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will go forth <i>and</i> surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then you will live and this city will not be burned with fire; and you will live—you and your house.

<p><sup>18</sup> But if you will not go forth <i>and</i> surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hands of the Chaldeans and they will burn it with fire; and you will not escape out of their hands.

<p><sup>19</sup> And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest the enemy deliver me into their <font color='#7a8080'>[these former subjects']</font> hands and they mock me <i>and</i> abuse me.

<p><sup>20</sup> But Jeremiah said, They will not deliver you <font color='#7a8080'>[to them]</font>. Obey, I beg of you, the voice of the Lord, Who speaks to you through me. Then it will be well with you, and you will live.

<p><sup>21</sup> But if you refuse to go forth <i>and</i> surrender to them, this is the word <font color='#7a8080'>[the vision]</font> that the Lord has shown me:

<p><sup>22</sup> Behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[in it]</font> all the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes and will say <font color='#7a8080'>[to you, King Zedekiah]</font>, Your friends have prevailed against your better judgment <i>and</i> have deceived you. Now when your feet are sunk in the mire <font color='#7a8080'>[of trouble]</font>, they have turned their backs.

<p><sup>23</sup> All your wives and your children will be brought out to the Chaldeans; and you <font color='#7a8080'>[yourself]</font> will not escape out of their hands, but you will be seized by the king of Babylon, and you will cause this city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> to be burned with fire.

<p><sup>24</sup> Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of this conversation and you will not die.

<p><sup>25</sup> But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say, Tell us what you said to the king and what he said to you; hide it not from us and we will not put you to death,

<p><sup>26</sup> Then you shall say to them, I was presenting to the king my humble plea that he would not send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.

<p><sup>27</sup> Then came all the princes to Jeremiah and asked him <font color='#7a8080'>[just what King Zedekiah had anticipated they would ask]</font>, and he told them all that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him, for what the conversation <font color='#7a8080'>[with the king]</font> had been was not discovered.

<p><sup>28</sup> So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken <font color='#7a8080'>[by the Chaldeans]</font>.

<h4>39</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it.

<p><sup>2</sup> And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, they broke into the city.

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[When Jerusalem was taken]</font> all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim <font color='#7a8080'>[the Rabsaris]</font> a chief of the eunuchs, and Nergal-sharezer <font color='#7a8080'>[II, the Rabmag]</font> a chief of the magicians, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>4</sup> And when Zedekiah king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went forth out of the city at night by way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the king]</font> went out toward the Arabah (the Jordan Valley).

<p><sup>5</sup> But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the <font color='#7a8080'>[Syrian]</font> land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence upon him.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes; also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.

<p><sup>7</sup> Moreover, he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with shackles to take him to Babylon.

<p><sup>8</sup> And the Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>9</sup> Then Nebuzaradan the <font color='#7a8080'>[chief executioner and]</font> captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, along with those who deserted to him, and the remainder of the <font color='#7a8080'>[so-called better class of]</font> people who were left.

<p><sup>10</sup> But Nebuzaradan the <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylonian]</font> captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poor of the people who had nothing, giving them vineyards and fields at the same time.

<p><sup>11</sup> Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

<p><sup>12</sup> Take him and look after him well; do him no harm but deal with him as he may ask of you.

<p><sup>13</sup> So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushasban <font color='#7a8080'>[the Rabsaris]</font> a chief of the eunuchs, Nergal-sharezer <font color='#7a8080'>[II, the Rabmag]</font> a chief of the magicians, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon

<p><sup>14</sup> Sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard and entrusted him to Gedaliah <font color='#7a8080'>[a prominent man whose father had once saved the prophet's life]</font> son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should take him home <font color='#7a8080'>[with him to Mizpah]</font>. So Jeremiah was released <i>and</i> dwelt among the people.

<p><sup>15</sup> Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was <font color='#7a8080'>[still]</font> shut up in the court of the guard, saying,

<p><sup>16</sup> Go and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring to pass My words against this city for evil and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you on that day.

<p><sup>17</sup> But I will deliver you <font color='#7a8080'>[Ebed-melech]</font> on that day, says the Lord, and you will not be given into the hands of the men of whom you are afraid.

<p><sup>18</sup> For I will surely deliver you; and you will not fall by the sword, but your life will be <font color='#7a8080'>[as your only booty and]</font> as a reward of battle to you, because you have put your trust in Me, says the Lord.

<h4>40</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all who were carried away captive from Jerusalem and Judah, who were taken as exiles to Babylon.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, The Lord your God pronounced evil upon this place.

<p><sup>3</sup> Now the Lord has brought it about and has done as He said: <font color='#7a8080'>[It is]</font> because you <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you.

<p><sup>4</sup> Now, see, I am freeing you today <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> from the chains upon your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will keep an eye on you <i>and</i> look after you well. But if it seems bad to you to come with me to Babylon, then do not do it. Behold, all the land is before you; wherever it seems good, right, <i>and</i> convenient for you to go, go there.

<p><sup>5</sup> While <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> was hesitating, <font color='#7a8080'>[the captain of the guard]</font> said, Go back then to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right for you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present and let him go.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.

<p><sup>7</sup> Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the open country <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah son of Ahikam governor in the land <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,

<p><sup>8</sup> They went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.

<p><sup>9</sup> And Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in <font color='#7a8080'>[this]</font> land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

<p><sup>10</sup> As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah to stand <font color='#7a8080'>[for you]</font> before the Chaldeans who come to us <font color='#7a8080'>[ministering to them and looking after the king's interests]</font>; but as for you, gather the juice <font color='#7a8080'>[of the grape]</font>, summer fruits and oil, and store them in your utensils <font color='#7a8080'>[chosen for such purposes]</font>, and dwell in your cities that you have seized.

<p><sup>11</sup> Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the people of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had set over them <font color='#7a8080'>[as governor]</font> Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,

<p><sup>12</sup> Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered a great abundance of juice <font color='#7a8080'>[of the grape]</font> and summer fruits.

<p><sup>13</sup> Moreover, Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah

<p><sup>14</sup> And said to him, Do you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he slay you and cause all the Jews who are gathered to you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?

<p><sup>16</sup> But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.

<h4>41</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now in the seventh month <font color='#7a8080'>[of that year]</font> Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal descendants and one of the princes of the king, came <font color='#7a8080'>[at the instigation of the Ammonites]</font> with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam in Mizpah. As they were eating a meal together there in Mizpah,

<p><sup>2</sup> Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him, the one whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.

<p><sup>3</sup> Ishmael <font color='#7a8080'>[manipulated by the Ammonites]</font> also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.

<p><sup>4</sup> And the second day after the slaying of Gedaliah, before anyone knew about it,

<p><sup>5</sup> There came eighty men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, having their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and having cut themselves, bringing cereal offerings and incense, going up <font color='#7a8080'>[to Jerusalem]</font> to present them in the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all the way as he went. As he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.

<p><sup>7</sup> And when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the <font color='#7a8080'>[city]</font> cistern pit—he and the men with him.

<p><sup>8</sup> But ten men were among them who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us! For we have stores hidden in the field—of wheat and barley and oil and honey. So he refrained and did not slay them with their brethren.

<p><sup>9</sup> Now the cistern pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain in addition to Gedaliah was the one which Asa the king <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> had once made for fear of Baasha king of Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[should Baasha lay siege to Mizpah]</font>. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.

<p><sup>10</sup> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—even the king's daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to cross over <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jordan]</font> to the Ammonites.

<p><sup>11</sup> But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,

<p><sup>12</sup> They took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.

<p><sup>13</sup> Now when all the people who were <font color='#7a8080'>[captives]</font> with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him, they were glad.

<p><sup>14</sup> So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan son of Kareah.

<p><sup>15</sup> But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.

<p><sup>16</sup> Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remainder of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam: <font color='#7a8080'>[they were]</font> the soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs whom <font color='#7a8080'>[Johanan]</font> had brought back from Gibeon.

<p><sup>17</sup> And they departed and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, <font color='#7a8080'>[intending]</font> to go to Egypt

<p><sup>18</sup> Because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land <font color='#7a8080'>[and whose death the king could avenge without much discrimination]</font>.

<h4>42</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah <font color='#7a8080'>[Azariah]</font> son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest came near

<p><sup>2</sup> And said to Jeremiah the prophet, We beseech you that you will let our supplication be presented before you and that you will pray to the Lord your God for us, even for all this remnant <font color='#7a8080'>[of the people of Judah]</font>; for whereas we were once many, there are but a few of us left, as you see with your <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> eyes.

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Pray]</font> that the Lord your God may show us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words; and it will be that whatever thing the Lord will answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then they said to Jeremiah, May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we fail to do according to all the things that the Lord your God sends you to tell us.

<p><sup>6</sup> Whether it is good or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to Whom we are sending you <font color='#7a8080'>[to inquire]</font>, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.

<p><sup>7</sup> And after ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.

<p><sup>8</sup> Then he called Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest,

<p><sup>9</sup> And said to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to Whom you sent me to present your supplication before Him:

<p><sup>10</sup> If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down, and I will plant you and not pull you up; for I will relent <i>and</i> comfort <i>and</i> ease Myself concerning the evil that <font color='#7a8080'>[in chastisement]</font> I have done to you <font color='#7a8080'>[and I will substitute mercy and loving-kindness for judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are fearful <font color='#7a8080'>[with the profound and reverent dread inspired by deity]</font>; be not afraid of him, says the Lord, for <font color='#7a8080'>[he is a mere man, while I am the all-wise, all-powerful, and ever-present God]</font> I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand.

<p><sup>12</sup> And I will grant mercy to you, that he may have mercy on you and permit you to remain in your own land.

<p><sup>13</sup> But if you say, We will not dwell in this land, and so disobey the voice of the Lord your God,

<p><sup>14</sup> Saying, No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,

<p><sup>15</sup> Then hear the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you are fully determined to go to Egypt and you do go to dwell there temporarily,

<p><sup>16</sup> Then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt <i>and</i> in it, and there you shall die.

<p><sup>17</sup> So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there temporarily; they will die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; none of them will remain or survive the evil that I will bring upon them.

<p><sup>18</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As My anger and My wrath have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall My wrath be poured forth upon you when you enter Egypt. You shall be a detested thing, an astonishment <i>and</i> horror, a curse, a thing lightly esteemed <i>and</i> a taunt <i>and</i> a reproach; you shall see this place no more.

<p><sup>19</sup> The Lord has said to you, O remnant of Judah, Do not go to Egypt. Know for a certainty that I <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> have warned <i>and</i> testified to you this day

<p><sup>20</sup> That you have dealt deceitfully against your own lives; for you sent me <font color='#7a8080'>[Jeremiah]</font> to the Lord your God, saying, Pray for us to the Lord our God; and whatever the Lord our God says, declare it to us and we will do it.

<p><sup>21</sup> And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God in anything that He sent me to tell you.

<p><sup>22</sup> Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place <font color='#7a8080'>[Egypt]</font> where you desire to go to dwell temporarily.

<h4>43</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And when Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God—everything for which the Lord their God had sent him to them—

<p><sup>2</sup> Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the proud <i>and</i> insolent men said to Jeremiah, You are not telling the truth! The Lord our God has not sent you to say, Do not go into Egypt to dwell there temporarily.

<p><sup>3</sup> But Baruch son of Neriah is setting you against us to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, so they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.

<p><sup>4</sup> So Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the Lord to remain in the land of Judah.

<p><sup>5</sup> But Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven—

<p><sup>6</sup> Even men, women, and children, the king's daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; also he took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.

<p><sup>7</sup> So they came into the land of Egypt—for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord. And they came to Tahpanhes.

<p><sup>8</sup> Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,

<p><sup>9</sup> Take large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the pavement of brick which is at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;

<p><sup>10</sup> And say to them, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant <font color='#7a8080'>[because he works for Me]</font>, and I <font color='#7a8080'>[through him]</font> will set his throne upon these stones that I have hidden; and his <font color='#7a8080'>[glittering, royal]</font> canopy will be stretched over them.

<p><sup>11</sup> And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt, giving such as are <font color='#7a8080'>[destined]</font> for death, to death, and such as are <font color='#7a8080'>[destined]</font> for captivity, to captivity, and such as are <font color='#7a8080'>[destined]</font> for the sword, to the sword.

<p><sup>12</sup> And I <font color='#7a8080'>[through him]</font> will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt; and he will burn <font color='#7a8080'>[the houses]</font> and carry <font color='#7a8080'>[the people]</font> away captive. And he will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment <font color='#7a8080'>[as he wills and when he chooses]</font>; and he will go away from there in peace.

<p><sup>13</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Nebuchadrezzar]</font> shall break also the images <i>and</i> obelisks of Heliopolis <font color='#7a8080'>[called On or Beth-shemesh—house of the sun]</font> in the land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.

<h4>44</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who were dwelling in the land of Egypt—at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis—and in the country of Pathros, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah; and see, this day they are a desolation and no man dwells in them

<p><sup>3</sup> Because of the wickedness which they committed, provoking Me to anger in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods that they did not know—neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.

<p><sup>4</sup> Yet I sent to you all My servants the prophets earnestly <i>and</i> persistently, saying, Oh, do not do this loathsome <i>and</i> shamefully vile thing that I hate <i>and</i> abhor!

<p><sup>5</sup> But they did not listen <i>and</i> obey or submit <i>and</i> consent to turn from their wickedness and burn no incense to other gods.

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and were kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became wasted and desolate, as it is this day.

<p><sup>7</sup> Therefore now thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves that will cut off from you man and woman, infant and weaned child, out of Judah, to leave yourselves with none remaining?

<p><sup>8</sup> Why do you provoke Me to anger with the works (idols) of your own hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you <font color='#7a8080'>[of your own accord]</font> have come to dwell temporarily, that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach (an object of reviling and taunts) among all the nations of the earth?

<p><sup>9</sup> Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives <font color='#7a8080'>[who clung to their foreign gods]</font>, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives <font color='#7a8080'>[who imitated their queens]</font>, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

<p><sup>10</sup> They are not humbled (contrite, penitent, and bruised for their guilt and iniquities) even to this day, neither have they feared <i>and</i> revered <font color='#7a8080'>[Me]</font> nor walked in My law or My statutes which I set before you and before your fathers.

<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set My face against you for evil—even to cut off all Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[from the land]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come into the land of Egypt to dwell here temporarily <font color='#7a8080'>[fleeing to Egypt instead of surrendering to the Chaldeans as directed by the Lord through Jeremiah]</font>, and they will all be consumed and will fall in the land of Egypt; they will be consumed by the sword and by famine. From the least even to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine. And they will be a detestable thing, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach (an object of horror, reviling, and taunts).

<p><sup>13</sup> For I will punish all the inhabitants of the land of Egypt as I have punished Jerusalem—by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence—

<p><sup>14</sup> So that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to the land of Egypt to dwell temporarily shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire <i>and</i> lift up their souls to return to dwell there; for none shall return except <font color='#7a8080'>[a few]</font> fugitives.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by—a great assembly—even all the people who dwelt in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:

<p><sup>16</sup> As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to <i>or</i> obey you.

<p><sup>17</sup> But we will certainly perform every word of the vows we have made: to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her as we have done—we and our fathers, our kings and our princes—in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off <i>and</i> prosperous and saw no evil.

<p><sup>18</sup> But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[And the wives said]</font> When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes <font color='#7a8080'>[in the shape of a star]</font> to represent <i>and</i> honor her and pour out drink offerings to her without <font color='#7a8080'>[the knowledge and approval of]</font> our husbands?

<p><sup>20</sup> Then Jeremiah said to all the people—to the men and to the women and to all the people who had given him that answer—

<p><sup>21</sup> The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land—did not the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember <font color='#7a8080'>[your idolatrous wickedness]</font> and did it not come into His mind?

<p><sup>22</sup> The Lord could no longer endure the evil of your doings and the abominations which you have committed; because of them therefore has your land become a desolation and an <font color='#7a8080'>[astonishing]</font> waste and a curse, without inhabitants, as it is this day.

<p><sup>23</sup> Because you have burned incense <font color='#7a8080'>[to idols]</font> and because you have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord or walked in His law and in His statutes and in His testimonies, therefore this evil has fallen upon you, as it is this day.

<p><sup>24</sup> Moreover, Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, Hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt,

<p><sup>25</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have both declared with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her. <font color='#7a8080'>[Surely]</font> then confirm your vows and <font color='#7a8080'>[surely]</font> perform your vows! <font color='#7a8080'>[If you will defy all My warnings to you, then, by all means, go ahead!]</font>

<p><sup>26</sup> Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all <font color='#7a8080'>[you people of]</font> Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says the Lord, that My name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord God lives.

<p><sup>27</sup> Behold, I am watching over them for evil and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine until there is an end of them <i>and</i> they are all destroyed.

<p><sup>28</sup> Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to dwell temporarily shall know whose words shall stand, Mine or theirs.

<p><sup>29</sup> And this will be the sign to you, says the Lord, that I will punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for evil.

<p><sup>30</sup> Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies and into the hands of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and was seeking his life.

<h4>45</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, unto you, O Baruch:

<p><sup>3</sup> You said, Woe is me now! For the Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning <i>and</i> sighing and I find no rest.

<p><sup>4</sup> Say this to him: The Lord speaks thus: Behold, what I have built I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up—and this means the whole land.

<p><sup>5</sup> And should you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not; for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, says the Lord, but your life I will give to you <font color='#7a8080'>[as your only booty and]</font> as a <font color='#7a8080'>[snatched]</font> prize of war wherever you go.

<h4>46</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning <i>and</i> against the <font color='#7a8080'>[Gentile]</font> nations.

<p><sup>2</sup> Concerning <i>and</i> against Egypt: against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote <i>and</i> defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:

<p><sup>3</sup> Put in order the buckler and shield, and advance for battle!

<p><sup>4</sup> Harness the horses, and mount, you horsemen! Stand forth with your helmets! Polish the spears, put on the coats of mail!

<p><sup>5</sup> Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and have turned backward, and their mighty warriors are beaten down. They flee in haste and look not back; terror is on every side! says the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> Let not the swift flee nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates they stumble and fall.

<p><sup>7</sup> Who is this that rises up like the Nile <font color='#7a8080'>[River]</font>, like the branches <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Nile in the delta of Egypt]</font> whose waters surge <i>and</i> toss?

<p><sup>8</sup> Egypt rises like the Nile, like the rivers whose waters surge <i>and</i> toss. She says, I will rise, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.

<p><sup>9</sup> Go up, you horses, and drive furiously, you chariots! Let the warriors go forth—men of Ethiopia and Put who handle the shield, men of Lud who are skilled in handling and stringing the bow.

<p><sup>10</sup> But that day is a day of the Lord, the Lord of hosts—a day of vengeance, that He may avenge Himself on His adversaries. And the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, the Lord of hosts has a sacrifice <font color='#7a8080'>[like that of a great sin offering]</font> in the north country by the river Euphrates.

<p><sup>11</sup> Go up into Gilead and take <font color='#7a8080'>[healing]</font> balm, O Virgin Daughter of Egypt! In vain do you use many medicines; for you there is no healing <i>or</i> remedy.

<p><sup>12</sup> The nations have heard of your disgrace <i>and</i> shame, and your cry has filled the earth. For warrior has stumbled against <i>and</i> thrown down warrior, and they have fallen both of them together.

<p><sup>13</sup> The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the coming of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and his smiting of the land of Egypt:

<p><sup>14</sup> Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol; and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes; say, Stand forth and get yourself ready, for the sword devours round about you.

<p><sup>15</sup> Why is your strong one <font color='#7a8080'>[the sacred bull-god Apis]</font> swept <i>and</i> dragged away? He stood not, because the Lord drove him <i>and</i> thrust him down.

<p><sup>16</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Lord]</font> made many to stumble <i>and</i> fall; yes, they fell one upon another. And they said, Arise, and let us go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword of the oppressor.

<p><sup>17</sup> They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is destroyed <i>and</i> is only a noise; he has let the appointed time <font color='#7a8080'>[in which God had him on probation]</font> pass by!

<p><sup>18</sup> As I live, says the King, Whose name is the Lord of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he <font color='#7a8080'>[the king of Babylon, standing out above other rulers]</font> come.

<p><sup>19</sup> O you daughter who dwells in Egypt <i>and</i> you who dwell with her, furnish yourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[with all you will need]</font> to go into exile, for Memphis will be waste, desolate, <i>and</i> burned up, without inhabitant.

<p><sup>20</sup> Egypt is a very fair heifer <font color='#7a8080'>[like Apis the bull-god, to which the country is, so to speak, espoused]</font>, but destruction <font color='#7a8080'>[a gadfly]</font> is coming—out of the north it is coming <font color='#7a8080'>[against her]</font>!

<p><sup>21</sup> Also her hired troops in the midst of her are like fatted calves <font color='#7a8080'>[in the stall]</font>, for they also are turned back and are fleeing together; they do not stand, because the day of their calamity is coming upon them, the time of their visitation (their inspection and punishment).

<p><sup>22</sup> The sound <font color='#7a8080'>[of Egypt fleeing from the enemy]</font> is like the rustling of an escaping serpent, for her foes advance with a mighty army and come against her with axes, like those who fell trees <i>and</i> cut wood.

<p><sup>23</sup> They shall cut down her forest, says the Lord, though it is impenetrable, because they <font color='#7a8080'>[the invading army]</font> are more numerous than locusts and cannot be counted.

<p><sup>24</sup> The Daughter of Egypt shall be disgraced; she shall be delivered into the hands of the people of the north <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldeans]</font>.

<p><sup>25</sup> The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will visit punishment upon Amon <font color='#7a8080'>[the chief god of the sacred city, the capital of Upper Egypt]</font> of No <i>or</i> Thebes, and upon Pharaoh and Egypt, with her gods and her kings—even Pharaoh and all those <font color='#7a8080'>[Jews and others]</font> who put their trust in <font color='#7a8080'>[Pharaoh as a support against Babylon]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> And I will deliver them into the hands of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hands of his servants. Afterward <font color='#7a8080'>[Egypt]</font> will be inhabited as in the days of old, says the Lord.

<p><sup>27</sup> But fear not, O My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel. For behold, I will save you from afar, and your offspring from the land of their exile; and Jacob will return and be quiet and at ease, and none will make him afraid.

<p><sup>28</sup> Fear not, O Jacob My servant, says the Lord, for I am with you. For I will make a full <i>and</i> complete end of all the nations to which I have driven you; yet I will not make a full end of you. But I will chasten <i>and</i> correct you in just measure, and I will not hold you guiltless by any means <i>or</i> leave you unpunished.

<h4>47</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh smote <font color='#7a8080'>[the Philistine city]</font> Gaza.

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord: Behold, waters are rising out of the north and shall become an overflowing stream and shall overflow the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell in it. Then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land <font color='#7a8080'>[of Philistia]</font> shall wail.

<p><sup>3</sup> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldean king's]</font> war-horses, at the rattling of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers do not look back to their children, so feeble are their hands <font color='#7a8080'>[with terror]</font>

<p><sup>4</sup> Because of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains. For the Lord is destroying the Philistines, the remnant <font color='#7a8080'>[still surviving]</font> of the isle <i>or</i> coastland of Caphtor <font color='#7a8080'>[where the Philistines originated]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> Baldness <font color='#7a8080'>[as a token of mourning]</font> will come upon Gaza; Ashkelon will be cut off <i>and</i> be dumb. O remnant of their valley <i>and</i> of the giants, how long will you gash yourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[as a token of mourning]</font>?

<p><sup>6</sup> O you sword of the Lord, how long will it be before you are quiet? Put yourself into your scabbard; rest and be still.

<p><sup>7</sup> How can it <font color='#7a8080'>[the sword of the Lord]</font> be quiet when the Lord has given it an assignment to discharge? Against Ashkelon and against the <font color='#7a8080'>[whole Philistine]</font> seashore He has appointed it.

<h4>48</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Concerning Moab: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to <font color='#7a8080'>[the city of]</font> Nebo, for it is laid waste! Kiriathaim is put to shame and taken; Misgab <font color='#7a8080'>[the high fortress]</font> is put to shame, broken down, <i>and</i> crushed.

<p><sup>2</sup> The glory of Moab is no more; in Heshbon <font color='#7a8080'>[a border town between Reuben and Gad, east of the Jordan River]</font> they planned evil against her, saying, Come, let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, O <font color='#7a8080'>[town of]</font> Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you.

<p><sup>3</sup> The sound of a cry from Horonaim, <font color='#7a8080'>[a cry of]</font> desolation and great destruction!

<p><sup>4</sup> Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard <font color='#7a8080'>[as far as Zoar]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> For the ascent of Luhith will be climbed <font color='#7a8080'>[by successive bands of fugitives]</font> with continual weeping; for on the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.

<p><sup>6</sup> Flee! Save your lives! But they shall be like a destitute <i>and</i> forsaken person in the wilderness.

<p><sup>7</sup> For because you have trusted in your works <font color='#7a8080'>[your bungling idol images]</font> and in your treasures <font color='#7a8080'>[instead of in God]</font>, you shall also be taken. And Chemosh <font color='#7a8080'>[your god]</font> shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.

<p><sup>8</sup> And the destroyer shall come upon every city; no city shall escape. The <font color='#7a8080'>[Jordan]</font> valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be devastated, as the Lord has said.

<p><sup>9</sup> Give wings to Moab, for <font color='#7a8080'>[by that means only]</font> she will flee and get away; her cities will be desolate, without any to dwell in them.

<p><sup>10</sup> Cursed be he who does the work of the Lord negligently <font color='#7a8080'>[with slackness, deceitfully]</font>; and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood <font color='#7a8080'>[in executing judgment pronounced by the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees <font color='#7a8080'>[like wine]</font> and has not been drawn off from one vessel to another, neither has he gone into exile. Therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent has not changed.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I shall send to <font color='#7a8080'>[Moab]</font> tilters who shall tilt him up and shall empty his vessels and break his bottles (earthenware) in pieces.

<p><sup>13</sup> And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh <font color='#7a8080'>[his god]</font>, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.

<p><sup>14</sup> How can you say, We are heroes and mighty men in the war?

<p><sup>15</sup> Moab has been made desolate, and his cities have gone up <font color='#7a8080'>[in smoke and flame]</font>; and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, Whose name is the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>16</sup> The destruction of Moab is coming near, and his calamity hastens swiftly.

<p><sup>17</sup> Bemoan him, all you <font color='#7a8080'>[nations]</font> who are around him, and all you <font color='#7a8080'>[nations more remote]</font> who know his name; say, How broken is the mighty scepter <font color='#7a8080'>[of national power]</font> and the splendid rod <font color='#7a8080'>[of glory]</font>!

<p><sup>18</sup> Come down from your glory, you inhabitant of the Daughter of Dibon, and sit on the ground among the thirsty! For the destroyer of Moab is advancing against you; he will destroy your strongholds.

<p><sup>19</sup> O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch! Ask him who flees and her who escapes, What has happened?

<p><sup>20</sup> Moab is put to shame, for she is broken down. Wail and cry out! Tell by <font color='#7a8080'>[the banks of]</font> the Arnon that Moab is laid waste (destroyed).

<p><sup>21</sup> Judgment has come upon the land of the plain—upon Holon and Jahzah and Mephaath,

<p><sup>22</sup> And upon Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim,

<p><sup>23</sup> And upon Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon,

<p><sup>24</sup> And upon Kerioth and Bozrah—and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.

<p><sup>25</sup> The horn (strength) of Moab is cut off, and his arm <font color='#7a8080'>[of authority]</font> is shattered, says the Lord.

<p><sup>26</sup> Make him drunk, for he has magnified himself against the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[by resisting Reuben's occupation of the land the Lord had assigned him]</font>. Moab also shall splash in his vomit, and he too shall be held in derision.

<p><sup>27</sup> For was not Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[an object of]</font> derision to you? Was he found among thieves—since whenever you speak of him you wag your head <font color='#7a8080'>[in scorn]</font>?

<p><sup>28</sup> O you inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities and dwell among the rocks, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the walls of the yawning ravine.

<p><sup>29</sup> We have heard of the <font color='#7a8080'>[giddy]</font> pride of Moab, the extremely proud one—his loftiness, his arrogance, his conceit, and the haughtiness of his heart.

<p><sup>30</sup> I know his insolent wrath, says the Lord, and the nothingness of his boastings <i>and</i> his deeds; they are false <i>and</i> have accomplished nothing.

<p><sup>31</sup> Therefore I will wail over Moab, and I will cry out over the whole of Moab. Over the men of Kir-heres (Kir-hareseth) there will be sighing <i>and</i> mourning.

<p><sup>32</sup> O vines of Sibmah, I weep for you more than the weeping of Jazer <font color='#7a8080'>[over its ruins and wasted vineyards]</font>. Your tendrils <font color='#7a8080'>[of influence]</font> have gone over the sea, reaching even to Jazer. The destroyer has fallen upon your summer fruit harvest and your <font color='#7a8080'>[season's]</font> crop of grapes.

<p><sup>33</sup> Joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful orchards <i>and</i> fields and from the land of Moab. And I have made the juice <font color='#7a8080'>[of the grape]</font> to fail from what is pressed out in the vats; no one treads <font color='#7a8080'>[the grapes]</font> with shouting. Their shouting is no shouting <font color='#7a8080'>[of joy, but is a battle cry]</font>.

<p><sup>34</sup> From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah <font color='#7a8080'>[like a three-year-old heifer]</font>, for even the waters of Nimrim have become desolations.

<p><sup>35</sup> Moreover, I will cause to cease in Moab, says the Lord, the one who ascends <i>and</i> offers in the high place and the one who burns incense to his gods.

<p><sup>36</sup> Therefore My heart moans <i>and</i> sighs for Moab like flutes, and My heart moans <i>and</i> sighs like flutes for the men of Kir-heres (Kir-hareseth); therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[the remnant of]</font> the abundant riches they gained has perished.

<p><sup>37</sup> For every head is shaven bald and every beard cut off: upon all the hands are cuts (slashes) and upon the loins is sackcloth <font color='#7a8080'>[all to express mourning]</font>.

<p><sup>38</sup> On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation everywhere, for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there is no pleasure, says the Lord.

<p><sup>39</sup> How it is broken down! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become <font color='#7a8080'>[an object of]</font> a derision and a <font color='#7a8080'>[horrifying]</font> terror to all who are round about him.

<p><sup>40</sup> For thus says the Lord: Behold, he <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> shall fly swiftly like an eagle and shall spread out his wings against Moab.

<p><sup>41</sup> Kerioth <font color='#7a8080'>[and the cities]</font> shall be taken and the strongholds seized; and the hearts of the mighty warriors of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs <font color='#7a8080'>[in childbirth]</font>.

<p><sup>42</sup> And Moab shall be destroyed from being a nation, because he has magnified himself against the Lord.

<p><sup>43</sup> Terror and pit and snare are before you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the Lord.

<p><sup>44</sup> He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit, and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken <i>and</i> caught in the trap <i>or</i> snare; for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation (their inspection and infliction of punishment), says the Lord.

<p><sup>45</sup> In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand powerless (stopped in their tracks, helpless and without strength), for a fire has gone forth from Heshbon, a flame from the midst of Sihon; it has destroyed the corner of Moab and the crowns of the heads of the ones in tumult <font color='#7a8080'>[the proud Moabites]</font>.

<p><sup>46</sup> Woe to you, O Moab! The people of <font color='#7a8080'>[the god]</font> Chemosh <i>are</i> undone; for your sons are taken away captive and your daughters into captivity.

<p><sup>47</sup> Yet will I reverse the captivity <i>and</i> restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says the Lord. Thus far is the judgment on Moab.

<h4>49</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Concerning <i>and</i> against the Ammonites: Thus says the Lord: Has Israel no sons <font color='#7a8080'>[to return after their captivity and claim the territory of Gad east of the Jordan which the Ammonites have taken over]</font>? Has <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel's Gad]</font> no heir? Why then has Milcom <font color='#7a8080'>[the god the Ammonites call their king]</font> dispossessed <i>and</i> inherited Gad, and <font color='#7a8080'>[why do]</font> his people dwell in Gad's cities?

<p><sup>2</sup> Therefore behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it <font color='#7a8080'>[the high ground on which it stands]</font> will become a desolate heap, and its daughter <font color='#7a8080'>[villages]</font> will be burned with fire. Then will Israel dispossess those who dispossessed him, says the Lord.

<p><sup>3</sup> Wail, O Heshbon <font color='#7a8080'>[in Moab, just south of Ammon]</font>, for Ai <font color='#7a8080'>[in Ammon]</font> is laid waste! Cry out, you daughter <font color='#7a8080'>[villages]</font> of Rabbah! Gird yourselves with sackcloth, lament, and run to and fro inside the <font color='#7a8080'>[sheepfold]</font> enclosures; for Milcom <font color='#7a8080'>[the god-king]</font> shall go into exile, together with his priests and his princes.

<p><sup>4</sup> Why do you boast of your valleys? Your valley flows away, O <font color='#7a8080'>[Ammon]</font> rebellious <i>and</i> faithless daughter, who trusted in her treasures, who said, Who can come against me?

<p><sup>5</sup> Behold, I will bring terror upon you, says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, from all who are round about you; and you will be driven out, each man fleeing straight before him <font color='#7a8080'>[without thought of his neighbor]</font>, and there will be no one to gather together the fugitives.

<p><sup>6</sup> And afterward I will reverse the captivity of the children of Ammon <i>and</i> restore their fortunes, says the Lord.

<p><sup>7</sup> Concerning <i>and</i> against Edom: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman <font color='#7a8080'>[a district in Edom]</font>? Has counsel vanished from the intelligent <i>and</i> prudent? Is their wisdom all poured out <i>and</i> used up?

<p><sup>8</sup> Flee, turn back, dwell deep <font color='#7a8080'>[in the deserts to escape the Chaldeans]</font>, O inhabitants of Dedan <font color='#7a8080'>[neighbor of Edom]</font>! For I will bring the calamity <i>and</i> destruction of Esau upon him <font color='#7a8080'>[Edom]</font> when I inspect <i>and</i> punish him.

<p><sup>9</sup> If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some ungleaned grapes? If thieves came by night, would they not destroy only what is enough <font color='#7a8080'>[for them]</font>?

<p><sup>10</sup> But I have stripped Esau (Edom) bare; I have uncovered his hiding places, and he cannot hide himself. His offspring will be destroyed, with his brethren and his neighbors; and he will be no more.

<p><sup>11</sup> Leave your fatherless children; I will <font color='#7a8080'>[do what is necessary to]</font> preserve them alive. And let <font color='#7a8080'>[those who have been made]</font> your widows trust <i>and</i> confide in Me.

<p><sup>12</sup> For thus says the Lord: Behold, they <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> whose rule was not to drink the cup <font color='#7a8080'>[of wrath]</font> shall assuredly drink—and are you to remain unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.

<p><sup>13</sup> For I have sworn by Myself, says the Lord, that Bozrah <font color='#7a8080'>[in Edom, between Petra and the Dead Sea]</font> shall become a horror, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.

<p><sup>14</sup> I have heard a report from the Lord, and a messenger is sent to the nations, saying, Gather together and come against her! And rise up for the battle.

<p><sup>15</sup> For, behold, I will make you <font color='#7a8080'>[Edom]</font> small among the nations and despised among men.

<p><sup>16</sup> Your <font color='#7a8080'>[object of]</font> horror (your idol) has deceived you, and the pride of your heart <font color='#7a8080'>[has deceived you]</font>, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock <font color='#7a8080'>[Sela or Petra]</font>, who hold <i>and</i> occupy the height of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as the eagle's, I will bring you down from there, says the Lord.

<p><sup>17</sup> And Edom shall be an astonishment <i>and</i> a horror; everyone who goes by it shall be astonished <i>and</i> shall hiss with horror at all its plagues <i>and</i> disasters.

<p><sup>18</sup> As <font color='#7a8080'>[it was]</font> in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says the Lord, no man shall dwell there; neither shall a son of man live in it temporarily.

<p><sup>19</sup> See, there comes up one <font color='#7a8080'>[Nebuchadnezzar]</font> like a lion from <font color='#7a8080'>[lurking in]</font> the jungles (the pride) of the Jordan against the strong habitation <font color='#7a8080'>[of Edom]</font> <i>and</i> into the permanent pastures; for in a twinkling I will drive him <font color='#7a8080'>[Edom]</font> from there. And I will appoint over him the one whom I choose. For who is like Me? And who will appoint for Me the time <i>and</i> prosecute Me for this proceeding? And what <font color='#7a8080'>[earthly, national]</font> shepherd can stand before Me <i>and</i> defy Me?

<p><sup>20</sup> Therefore hear the plan of the Lord which He has made against Edom, and His purposes which He has formed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall be dragged away <font color='#7a8080'>[by Nebuchadnezzar]</font>, even the little ones of the flock; surely He shall make their habitation desolate because of them <i>and</i> their fold shocked at their fate.

<p><sup>21</sup> At the sound of their fall the earth shall tremble; at their crying the sound shall be heard at the Red Sea.

<p><sup>22</sup> Behold, one will come up and fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against <font color='#7a8080'>[the Edomite city of]</font> Bozrah; and in that day the hearts of the mighty warriors of Edom will be like the heart of a woman in her pangs <font color='#7a8080'>[in childbirth]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> Concerning <i>and</i> against Damascus <font color='#7a8080'>[in Syria]</font>: Hamath and Arpad are confounded <i>and</i> put to shame, for they have heard bad news; they are fainthearted <i>and</i> wasting away; there is trouble <i>and</i> anxiety <font color='#7a8080'>[like]</font> on a <font color='#7a8080'>[storm-tossed]</font> sea which cannot rest.

<p><sup>24</sup> Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee, and terror <i>and</i> panic have seized her; anguish and sorrow have taken hold of her, like a woman in childbirth.

<p><sup>25</sup> How <font color='#7a8080'>[remarkable that]</font> the renowned city is not deserted, the city of my joy! <font color='#7a8080'>[exclaims one from Damascus]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed in that day, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>27</sup> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will consume the palaces of Ben-hadad <font color='#7a8080'>[title of several kings of Syria]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> Concerning Kedar <font color='#7a8080'>[a tribe of nomad Arabs]</font> and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite: Thus says the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[to him]</font>: Arise, go up against Kedar and destroy the sons of the east.

<p><sup>29</sup> Their tents and their flocks shall they <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldeans]</font> take—their tent hangings and all their utensils and their camels. And men shall cry to them, Terror on every side!

<p><sup>30</sup> Flee, wander far off, dwell deep <font color='#7a8080'>[in the deserts]</font>, O you inhabitants of Hazor <font color='#7a8080'>[in the Arabian Desert]</font> says the Lord, for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has planned a course against you and has conceived a purpose against you.

<p><sup>31</sup> Arise <font color='#7a8080'>[Nebuchadrezzar]</font>, get up into a nation which is at ease, which dwells without care, says the Lord, <font color='#7a8080'>[a nation]</font> which has neither gates nor bars, which dwells apart <i>and</i> alone.

<p><sup>32</sup> And their camels will be booty, and their herds of cattle a spoil; and I will scatter to all <font color='#7a8080'>[the four]</font> winds those who <font color='#7a8080'>[as evidence of their idolatry]</font> clip off the corners of their hair, and I will bring their calamity from every side, says the Lord.

<p><sup>33</sup> And Hazor shall become a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever; no man shall dwell there; neither shall a son of man live in it temporarily.

<p><sup>34</sup> The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning <i>and</i> against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

<p><sup>35</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief <font color='#7a8080'>[weapon and part]</font> of their strength.

<p><sup>36</sup> And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four corners of heaven; and I will scatter them toward all those winds, and there will be no nation to which the outcasts of Elam will not come.

<p><sup>37</sup> And I will cause Elam to be dismayed <i>and</i> terrified before their enemies and before those who seek <i>and</i> demand their lives; and I will bring evil <i>and</i> disaster upon them, even My fierce anger, says the Lord. And I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them.

<p><sup>38</sup> And I will set My throne <font color='#7a8080'>[of judgment]</font> in Elam <font color='#7a8080'>[whose capital city was Shushan, from which God wrought wonders through Nehemiah, Esther, and Daniel]</font>; and I will destroy from their king and princes, says the Lord.

<p><sup>39</sup> But it shall be in the latter days (the end of days) that I will reverse the captivity and restore the fortunes of Elam, says the Lord.

<h4>50</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word that the Lord spoke concerning <i>and</i> against Babylon and concerning <i>and</i> against the land of the Chaldeans through Jeremiah the prophet:

<p><sup>2</sup> Declare it among the nations and publish it and set up a signal <font color='#7a8080'>[to spread the news]</font>—publish and conceal it not; say, Babylon has been taken; Bel <font color='#7a8080'>[the patron god]</font> is put to shame, Merodach (Bel) is dismayed <i>and</i> broken down. <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon's]</font> images are put to shame, her <font color='#7a8080'>[senseless]</font> idols are thrown down!

<p><sup>3</sup> For out of the north there has come up a nation <font color='#7a8080'>[Media]</font> against her which will make her land desolate, and none will dwell there. They will have fled, they will be gone—from man even to beast.

<p><sup>4</sup> In those days and at that time, says the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall come up weeping as they come and seek the Lord their God <font color='#7a8080'>[inquiring for and of Him and requiring Him, both by right of necessity and of the promises of God's Word]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> They shall ask the way to Zion, with their faces in that direction, saying, Come, let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.

<p><sup>6</sup> My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray <font color='#7a8080'>[to favorite places of idolatry]</font> on mountains <font color='#7a8080'>[that seduce]</font>. They have gone from <font color='#7a8080'>[one sin to another]</font> mountain to hill; they have forgotten their <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> resting-place.

<p><sup>7</sup> All who found them devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[and are no longer holy to Him]</font>, their true habitation of righteousness <i>and</i> justice, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers.

<p><sup>8</sup> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans; and be as the he-goats <font color='#7a8080'>[who serve as examples and as leaders in the flight]</font> before the flocks.

<p><sup>9</sup> For behold, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country. They will equip <i>and</i> set themselves against her; from there she will be taken. Their arrows will be like <font color='#7a8080'>[both]</font> an expert, mighty warrior <i>and</i> like his arrows—none <font color='#7a8080'>[of them]</font> will return in vain.

<p><sup>10</sup> And Chaldea shall become plunder; all who plunder her shall be satisfied, says the Lord.

<p><sup>11</sup> Though you are glad, though you rejoice, O you who plunder My heritage, though you are wanton <i>and</i> skip about like a heifer at grass and neigh like strong stallions,

<p><sup>12</sup> Your mother <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> shall be put to great shame; she who bore you shall blush <i>and</i> be disgraced. Behold, she shall be at the rear of the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[least of the nations]</font>—a wilderness, waste, and desert.

<p><sup>13</sup> Because of the wrath of the Lord she shall not be inhabited but shall be wholly desolate; everyone who goes by Babylon shall be appalled and hiss <i>and</i> mock at all her wounds <i>and</i> plagues.

<p><sup>14</sup> Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all you archers. Shoot at her! Spare not the arrows, for she has sinned against the Lord.

<p><sup>15</sup> Raise the battle cry against her round about! She gives her hand <font color='#7a8080'>[in agreement]</font> <i>and</i> surrenders; her supports <i>and</i> battlements fall, her walls are thrown down. For this is the vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance on her; as she has done <font color='#7a8080'>[to others]</font>, do to her.

<p><sup>16</sup> Exterminate the sower from Babylon, and the one who handles the sickle in the time of harvest. For fear of the sword of the oppressor everyone shall return to his people, and everyone shall flee to his own land.

<p><sup>17</sup> Israel is a hunted <i>and</i> scattered sheep <font color='#7a8080'>[driven hither and thither and preyed upon by savage beasts]</font>; the lions have chased him. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken <i>and</i> gnawed his bones.

<p><sup>18</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will visit <i>and</i> punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I visited <i>and</i> punished the king of Assyria.

<p><sup>19</sup> And I will bring Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[home]</font> again to his fold <i>and</i> pasturage, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan <font color='#7a8080'>[in the most fertile districts both west and east]</font>, and his soul will be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.

<p><sup>20</sup> In those days and at that time, says the Lord, the iniquity of Israel will be sought, but there will be none, and the sins of Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[will be sought]</font>, but none will be found, for I will pardon those whom I cause to remain as a remnant (the preserved ones who come forth after a long tribulation).

<p><sup>21</sup> Go up against <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> the land of Merathaim <font color='#7a8080'>[two rebellions, double or intense defiance]</font>, even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod <font color='#7a8080'>[visitation and punishment]</font>. Slay and utterly destroy them, says the Lord, and do according to all that I have commanded you.

<p><sup>22</sup> The cry <i>and</i> noise of battle is in the land, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the noise]</font> of great destruction.

<p><sup>23</sup> How the hammer of the whole earth is crushed and broken! How Babylon has become a horror of desolation among the nations!

<p><sup>24</sup> I set a trap for you, and you also were taken, O Babylon, and you did not know it; you were found and also caught because you have struggled <i>and</i> contended against the Lord.

<p><sup>25</sup> The Lord has opened His armory and has brought forth <font color='#7a8080'>[the nations who unknowingly are]</font> the weapons of His indignation <i>and</i> wrath, for the Lord God of hosts has work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.

<p><sup>26</sup> Come against her from every quarter <i>and</i> from the utmost border. Open her granaries <i>and</i> storehouses; pile up <font color='#7a8080'>[their contents]</font> like heaps of rubbish. Burn <i>and</i> destroy her utterly; let nothing be left of her.

<p><sup>27</sup> Slay all her bullocks (her choice youths, the strength of her army); let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldeans]</font>! For their day has come, the time of their visitation (their inspection and punishment).

<p><sup>28</sup> Listen! The voice of those <font color='#7a8080'>[Jews]</font> who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon proclaiming in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Lord upon the Chaldeans]</font> for <font color='#7a8080'>[the plundering and destruction of]</font> His temple.

<p><sup>29</sup> Call together <font color='#7a8080'>[many]</font> archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp against her round about; let none from there escape. Recompense her according to her deeds; just as she has done, do to her. For against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel, has she been proudly defiant <i>and</i> presumptuous.

<p><sup>30</sup> Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets <i>and</i> squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, says the Lord.

<p><sup>31</sup> Behold, I am against you, O Babylon <font color='#7a8080'>[you who are pride and presumption personified]</font>, says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, for your day has come, the time when I will visit <i>and</i> punish you.

<p><sup>32</sup> And Pride (the arrogant one) shall stumble (totter) and fall, and none shall raise him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are round about him.

<p><sup>33</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; all who took them captive have held them fast; they refuse to let them go.

<p><sup>34</sup> Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is His name. He will surely <i>and</i> thoroughly plead their case <i>and</i> defend their cause, that He may give rest to <font color='#7a8080'>[the land of Israel and to the Babylonian-enslaved nations of]</font> the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.

<p><sup>35</sup> A sword upon the Chaldeans, says the Lord—upon the inhabitants of Babylon and upon her princes (rulers in civic matters) and upon her wise men (the astrologers and rulers in religious affairs)!

<p><sup>36</sup> A sword upon the babbling liars (the diviners), that they may become fools! A sword upon her mighty warriors, that they may be dismayed <i>and</i> destroyed!

<p><sup>37</sup> A sword upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mixed foreign troops that are in the midst of her, that they may become <font color='#7a8080'>[as weak and defenseless as]</font> women! A sword upon her treasures, that they may be plundered!

<p><sup>38</sup> A sword <i>and</i> a drought upon her waters, that they may be dried up! For it is a land of images, and they are mad over idols (objects of terror in which they foolishly trust).

<p><sup>39</sup> Therefore wild beasts of the desert shall dwell <font color='#7a8080'>[in Babylon]</font> with the jackals, and ostriches shall dwell there. And it shall never again be inhabited with people, even from generation to generation.

<p><sup>40</sup> As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says the Lord, so no man shall dwell there; neither shall any son of man live there temporarily.

<p><sup>41</sup> Behold, a people is coming from the north; and a great nation and many kings are stirring from the uttermost parts of the earth.

<p><sup>42</sup> They lay hold of bow, lance, <i>and</i> spear; they are cruel <i>and</i> have no mercy <i>or</i> compassion. They sound like the roaring of the sea; they ride upon horses, every man equipped like a man <font color='#7a8080'>[ready]</font> for the battle against you, O Daughter of Babylon!

<p><sup>43</sup> The king of Babylon has heard the news about them, and his hands fall feeble <i>and</i> helpless; anguish has seized him, and pangs like that of a woman in childbirth.

<p><sup>44</sup> See, there comes up one like a lion from the jungles (the pride) of the Jordan against the strong habitation <font color='#7a8080'>[of Babylon]</font> <i>and</i> into the permanent pasturage <i>and</i> sheepfold; for in a twinkling I will drive him <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> from there. And I will appoint over him the one whom I choose. For who is like Me? And who will challenge Me <i>and</i> prosecute Me for this proceeding? And what <font color='#7a8080'>[earthly, national]</font> shepherd can stand before Me <i>and</i> defy Me?

<p><sup>45</sup> Therefore hear the plan of the Lord which He has made against Babylon, and His purposes which He has formed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall be dragged away, even the little ones of the flock; surely He shall make their habitation desolate because of them <i>and</i> their fold amazed <i>and</i> appalled at their fate.

<p><sup>46</sup> At the cry, Babylon has been taken! the earth shall tremble, and the cry shall be heard among the nations.

<h4>51</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon and against those who dwell among those rebelling against Me a destroying wind <i>and</i> spirit;

<p><sup>2</sup> And I will send to Babylon strangers <i>or</i> winnowers who will winnow her and will empty her land; for in the day of calamity they will be against her on every side.

<p><sup>3</sup> Against him who bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail. And spare not her young men; devote <font color='#7a8080'>[to God]</font> and utterly destroy her entire host.

<p><sup>4</sup> Thus they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and wounded in her streets.

<p><sup>5</sup> For Israel has not been widowed <i>and</i> forsaken, nor has Judah, by his God, the Lord of hosts, though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>6</sup> Flee out of the midst of Babylon! Let every man save his life! Let not destruction come upon you through her <font color='#7a8080'>[punishment for]</font> sin <i>and</i> guilt. For it is the time of the Lord's vengeance; He will render to her a recompense.

<p><sup>7</sup> Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord's hand, making all the earth drunken. The nations drank of her wine; therefore the nations have gone mad.

<p><sup>8</sup> Babylon has suddenly fallen and is shattered (destroyed)! Wail for her <font color='#7a8080'>[if you care to]</font>! Get balm for her <font color='#7a8080'>[incurable]</font> pain; if <font color='#7a8080'>[you do]</font> so she may <font color='#7a8080'>[possibly]</font> be healed!

<p><sup>9</sup> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her and let us each go to his own country, for her guilt <i>and</i> the judgment against her reach to heaven and are lifted even to the skies.

<p><sup>10</sup> The Lord has brought forth <i>and</i> made known the righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[of our cause]</font>; come and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.

<p><sup>11</sup> Make clean <i>and</i> sharp the arrows, take up the shields <i>or</i> coats of armor <font color='#7a8080'>[and cover your bodies with them]</font>! The Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes <font color='#7a8080'>[who with the Persians will destroy the Babylonian Empire]</font>, for His purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it; for that is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance <font color='#7a8080'>[upon Babylon for the plundering and destruction]</font> of His temple.

<p><sup>12</sup> Set up a standard <i>or</i> signal <font color='#7a8080'>[to spread the news]</font> upon the walls of Babylon! Make the watch <i>and</i> blockade strong, set the guards, prepare the ambushes! For the Lord has both purposed and done that which He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.

<p><sup>13</sup> O <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, and the line measuring your life is cut.

<p><sup>14</sup> The Lord of hosts has sworn by Himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with <font color='#7a8080'>[a swarm of]</font> locusts <font color='#7a8080'>[who strip a land clean]</font>, and they will lift up a song <i>and</i> shout <font color='#7a8080'>[of victory]</font> over you.

<p><sup>15</sup> He made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.

<p><sup>16</sup> When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from His treasuries.

<p><sup>17</sup> Every man has become stupid <i>and</i> brutelike, without knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[of God]</font>; every goldsmith is put to shame by the images he has made; for his molten idols are a lie, and there is no breath <font color='#7a8080'>[of life]</font> in them.

<p><sup>18</sup> They are worthless (emptiness, falsity, futility), a work of delusion <i>and</i> worthy of derision; in the time of their inspection <i>and</i> punishment they shall <font color='#7a8080'>[helplessly]</font> perish.

<p><sup>19</sup> Not like these <font color='#7a8080'>[gods]</font> is He Who is the Portion of Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[the true God on Whom Israel has a claim]</font>, for He is the One Who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance—the Lord of hosts is His name.

<p><sup>20</sup> You <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus of Persia, soon to conquer Babylon]</font> are My battle-ax <i>or</i> maul and weapon of war—for with you I break nations in pieces, with you I destroy kingdoms,

<p><sup>21</sup> With you I break in pieces the horse and his rider, with you I break in pieces the chariot and the charioteer,

<p><sup>22</sup> With you I break in pieces man and woman, with you I break in pieces old man and youth, with you I break in pieces young man and maiden,

<p><sup>23</sup> With you I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock, with you I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen, and with you I break in pieces governors and commanders.

<p><sup>24</sup> And I will <font color='#7a8080'>[completely]</font> repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil that they have done in Zion—before your very eyes <font color='#7a8080'>[I will do it]</font>, says the Lord.

<p><sup>25</sup> Behold, I am against you, says the Lord, O destroying mountain <font color='#7a8080'>[which is burning out, you who will be as barren and desolate as an extinct volcano]</font>, you who <font color='#7a8080'>[would]</font> destroy the whole earth. I will stretch out My hand over <i>and</i> against you and roll you down from the <font color='#7a8080'>[burnt]</font> crags and will make you a burnt-out mountain <font color='#7a8080'>[of combustive fires]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[O Babylon]</font> they shall not take your cracked stones for a cornerstone, or any stone for foundations, but you shall be waste <i>and</i> desolate forever, says the Lord.

<p><sup>27</sup> Set up a standard <i>or</i> signal in the land <font color='#7a8080'>[to spread the news]</font>! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare <i>and</i> dedicate the nations for war against her; call against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up like <font color='#7a8080'>[a swarm of]</font> locusts <font color='#7a8080'>[when their wings are not yet released from their horny cases]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> Prepare <i>and</i> dedicate the nations for war against her—the kings of Media, with their governors and commanders (deputies), and every land of their dominion.

<p><sup>29</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[I foresee this:]</font> The land trembles and writhes in pain <i>and</i> sorrow, for the purposes of the Lord against Babylon stand—to make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.

<p><sup>30</sup> The mighty warriors of Babylon have ceased to fight; they have remained in their holds. Their might has failed; they have become <font color='#7a8080'>[weak and helpless]</font> like women. Her dwelling places are burned up; her bars <font color='#7a8080'>[and defenses generally]</font> are broken.

<p><sup>31</sup> One post shall run to meet another and one messenger to meet another to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every side <i>and</i> to its farthest end,

<p><sup>32</sup> And that the passages <font color='#7a8080'>[or ferries across the Euphrates]</font> are stopped, and the great marshes they <font color='#7a8080'>[the Medes]</font> have burned with fire, and the men of war are frightened.

<p><sup>33</sup> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: The Daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is <font color='#7a8080'>[being prepared]</font>; yet a little while and the time of harvest shall come to her.

<p><sup>34</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The inhabitants of Zion say]</font> Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has devoured us, he has crushed us, he has made us an empty vessel. Like a monster he has swallowed us up, he has filled his belly with our delicacies; he has rinsed us out <i>and</i> cast us away.

<p><sup>35</sup> May the violence done to me and to my flesh <i>and</i> blood be upon Babylon, will the inhabitant of Zion say; and, May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, will Jerusalem say.

<p><sup>36</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her lake <i>or</i> great reservoir and make her fountain dry.

<p><sup>37</sup> And Babylon shall become heaps <font color='#7a8080'>[of ruins]</font>, a dwelling place of jackals, a horror (an astonishing desolation) and a hissing <font color='#7a8080'>[of amazement]</font>, without inhabitant.

<p><sup>38</sup> They <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldean lords]</font> shall be roaring together <font color='#7a8080'>[before their sudden capture]</font> like young lions <font color='#7a8080'>[over their prey]</font>, they <font color='#7a8080'>[the princes]</font> shall be growling like lions' whelps.

<p><sup>39</sup> When the revelers are inflamed <font color='#7a8080'>[with wine and lust during their drinking bouts]</font>, I will prepare them a feast <font color='#7a8080'>[of My wrath]</font> and make them drunk, that they may rejoice and fall asleep to a perpetual sleep and not waken, says the Lord.

<p><sup>40</sup> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams together with he-goats.

<p><sup>41</sup> How Sheshach <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> is taken! And the praise of the whole earth is surprised <i>and</i> seized! How Babylon has become an astonishing desolation <i>and</i> a horror among the nations!

<p><sup>42</sup> The sea has come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the tumult <i>and</i> multitude of its waves.

<p><sup>43</sup> Her cities have become a desolation <i>and</i> a horror, a land of drought and a wilderness, a land in which no one lives, nor does any son of man pass through it.

<p><sup>44</sup> And I will punish <i>and</i> execute judgment upon Bel <font color='#7a8080'>[the god]</font> in Babylon and take out of his mouth what he has swallowed up <font color='#7a8080'>[the sacred vessels and the people of Judah and elsewhere who were taken captive]</font>. The nations will not flow any more to him. Yes, the wall of Babylon has fallen!

<p><sup>45</sup> My people, come out of the midst of her! And let every man save his life from the fierce anger of the Lord!

<p><sup>46</sup> And beware, lest your heart faint and you be afraid at the report (rumor) heard in the land; for in one year shall one report come and in another year another report, and violence shall be in the land, ruler against ruler.

<p><sup>47</sup> Therefore behold, the days will come when I will execute judgment <i>and</i> punishment upon the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be confounded <i>and</i> put to shame, and all her slain will fall in the midst of her.

<p><sup>48</sup> Then heaven and earth and all that is in them shall sing for joy over Babylon, for the <font color='#7a8080'>[Median]</font> destroyers shall come against her from the north, says the Lord.

<p><sup>49</sup> As Babylon caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all <font color='#7a8080'>[her]</font> land.

<p><sup>50</sup> You who have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still! <font color='#7a8080'>[Seriously and earnestly]</font> remember the Lord from afar <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font>, and let <font color='#7a8080'>[desolate]</font> Jerusalem come into your mind.

<p><sup>51</sup> We are confounded <i>and</i> ashamed, for we have heard reproach; confusion <i>and</i> shame have covered our faces, for strangers have come into the <font color='#7a8080'>[most]</font> sacred parts of the sanctuary of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[even those forbidden for entrance by all but the high priest or the appointed priests]</font>.

<p><sup>52</sup> Therefore behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will execute judgment upon <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon's]</font> idols <i>and</i> images, and throughout all her land the wounded will groan.

<p><sup>53</sup> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify her strong height (her lofty stronghold), yet destroyers will come upon her from Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>54</sup> The sound of a cry <font color='#7a8080'>[comes]</font> from Babylon, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the sound of]</font> great destruction <i>and</i> ruin from the land of the Chaldeans!

<p><sup>55</sup> For the Lord is destroying Babylon <i>and</i> laying her waste and stilling her great voice <font color='#7a8080'>[the hum of the city's life]</font>. And the waves <font color='#7a8080'>[of her conquerors]</font> roar like great waters, the noise of their voices is raised up <font color='#7a8080'>[like the tramping of an army]</font>.

<p><sup>56</sup> For the destroyer is coming upon her, upon Babylon; and her mighty warriors are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for the Lord is a God of recompense; He will surely requite.

<p><sup>57</sup> And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her commanders (deputies) and her mighty warriors; and they will sleep a perpetual sleep and not waken, says the King—the Lord of hosts is His name.

<p><sup>58</sup> Thus says the Lord of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown <i>and</i> <font color='#7a8080'>[the foundations]</font> made bare, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; the peoples shall labor in vain, and the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> to satisfy the fire, and they shall be weary.

<p><sup>59</sup> The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now this Seraiah was chief chamberlain <i>or</i> quartermaster <font color='#7a8080'>[and brother of Baruch]</font>.

<p><sup>60</sup> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon—even all these words that are written against Babylon.

<p><sup>61</sup> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, see to it that you read all these words.

<p><sup>62</sup> Then say, O Lord, You have spoken concerning this place that it shall be cut off, so that nothing shall remain and dwell in it, neither man nor beast; but it shall be desolate forever.

<p><sup>63</sup> And it shall be that when you have finished reading this book, you shall bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates.

<p><sup>64</sup> Then say, Thus will Babylon sink and not rise because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and <font color='#7a8080'>[the Babylonians]</font> will be weary (hopelessly exhausted). Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

<h4>52</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah <font color='#7a8080'>[not the prophet]</font> of Libnah.

<p><sup>2</sup> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

<p><sup>3</sup> For all this came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah because of the anger of the Lord, and <font color='#7a8080'>[in the end]</font> He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>4</sup> And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem; and they pitched against it and built moveable towers <i>and</i> siege mounds against it round about.

<p><sup>5</sup> So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

<p><sup>6</sup> And in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was so severe in the city that there was no bread for the people of the land.

<p><sup>7</sup> Then the city <font color='#7a8080'>[wall]</font> was broken through, so that all the men of war might flee, and they went forth out of the city by night <font color='#7a8080'>[as Ezekiel had foretold]</font> by way of the gate between the two walls by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were round about the city. And they <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jewish soldiers fled]</font> by way of the Arabah (the Jordan Valley).

<p><sup>8</sup> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.

<p><sup>9</sup> Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the <font color='#7a8080'>[Syrian]</font> land of Hamath <font color='#7a8080'>[on the northern border of Israel]</font>, where he pronounced sentence upon him.

<p><sup>10</sup> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he slew also all the princes of Judah at Riblah.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with shackles and carried him to Babylon and put him in prison <font color='#7a8080'>[mill]</font> till the day of his death.

<p><sup>12</sup> Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, there came to Jerusalem Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, who stood <i>and</i> served before the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>13</sup> And he burned the house of the Lord and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he consumed with fire.

<p><sup>14</sup> And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls round about Jerusalem.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and those who were left in the city <font color='#7a8080'>[at the time it was captured]</font>, along with those who went out to the king of Babylon <font color='#7a8080'>[during the siege]</font> and the remnant of the multitude <font color='#7a8080'>[the country's working people]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and tillers of the soil.

<p><sup>17</sup> Also the pillars of bronze that belonged to the house of the Lord, and the bronze bases <i>or</i> pedestals <font color='#7a8080'>[which supported the ten basins]</font> and the bronze Sea <i>or</i> huge laver that were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke into pieces and carried all the bronze of them to Babylon.

<p><sup>18</sup> The pots <font color='#7a8080'>[for carrying away ashes]</font> also and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service they took away.

<p><sup>19</sup> Also the small bowls and the firepans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the incense cups and the bowls for the drink offerings—whatever was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and whatever was of silver as silver.

<p><sup>20</sup> The two pillars, one Sea <i>or</i> huge laver, and twelve bronze bulls <i>or</i> oxen under the Sea, which King Solomon had made in the house of the Lord—the bronze of all these things was beyond weighing.

<p><sup>21</sup> Concerning the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits (twenty-seven feet), and an ornamental molding of twelve cubits (eighteen feet) went around its circumference; it was four fingers thick, and it <font color='#7a8080'>[the pillar]</font> was hollow.

<p><sup>22</sup> An upper part <i>or</i> capital of bronze was on top of it. The height of one capital was five cubits (seven and one-half feet), with a network and pomegranates around it, all of bronze. The second pillar also, with its pomegranates, was similar to these.

<p><sup>23</sup> And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; and all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about.

<p><sup>24</sup> And the captain of the guard took <font color='#7a8080'>[as prisoners]</font> Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door.

<p><sup>25</sup> He took also out of the city a court officer who had been overseer of the soldiers, and seven men of them who were next to the king <font color='#7a8080'>[as advisers]</font> <i>and</i> saw his face, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the prince <i>or</i> captain of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.

<p><sup>26</sup> And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

<p><sup>27</sup> And the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.

<p><sup>28</sup> This is the number of people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;

<p><sup>29</sup> In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons;

<p><sup>30</sup> In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylonian]</font> guard carried away captive of the Jews 745 persons. All the persons were 4,600.

<p><sup>31</sup> And in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin <font color='#7a8080'>[also called Coniah and Jeconiah]</font> king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[and showed favor to him]</font> and brought him out of prison.

<p><sup>32</sup> He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were <font color='#7a8080'>[captives]</font> with him in Babylon,

<p><sup>33</sup> Jehoiachin put off his prison garments, and he dined regularly at the king's table all the days of his life.

<p><sup>34</sup> And his allowance, a continual one, was given him by the king of Babylon, a portion according to his requirements until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
