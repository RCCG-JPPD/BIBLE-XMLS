<h4>1</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The burden <i>or</i> oracle (the thing to be lifted up) which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
<p><sup>2</sup> O Lord, how long shall I cry for help and You will not hear? Or cry out to You of violence and You will not save?

<p><sup>3</sup> Why do You show me iniquity <i>and</i> wrong, and Yourself look upon <i>or</i> cause me to see perverseness <i>and</i> trouble? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention arises.

<p><sup>4</sup> Therefore the law is slackened and justice <i>and</i> a righteous sentence never go forth, for the <font color='#7a8080'>[hostility of the]</font> wicked surrounds the <font color='#7a8080'>[uncompromisingly]</font> righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.

<p><sup>5</sup> Look around <font color='#7a8080'>[you, Habakkuk, replied the Lord]</font> among the nations and see! And be astonished! Astounded! For I am putting into effect a work in your days <font color='#7a8080'>[such]</font> that you would not believe it if it were told you.

<p><sup>6</sup> For behold, I am rousing up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation who march through the breadth of the earth to take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them.

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Chaldeans]</font> are terrible and dreadful; their justice and dignity proceed <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> from themselves.

<p><sup>8</sup> Their horses also are swifter than leopards and are fiercer than the evening wolves, and their horsemen spread themselves <i>and</i> press on proudly; yes, their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle that hastens to devour.

<p><sup>9</sup> They all come for violence; their faces turn eagerly forward, and they gather prisoners together like sand.

<p><sup>10</sup> They scoff at kings, and rulers are a derision to them; they ridicule every stronghold, for they heap up dust <font color='#7a8080'>[for earth mounds]</font> and take it.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then they sweep by like a wind and pass on, and they load themselves with guilt, <font color='#7a8080'>[as do all men]</font> whose own power is their god.

<p><sup>12</sup> Are not You from everlasting, O Lord my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O Lord, You have appointed <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldean]</font> to execute <font color='#7a8080'>[Your]</font> judgment, and You, O Rock, have established him for chastisement <i>and</i> correction.

<p><sup>13</sup> You are of purer eyes than to behold evil and can not look <font color='#7a8080'>[inactively]</font> upon injustice. Why then do You look upon the plunderer? Why are you silent when the wicked one destroys him who is more righteous than <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldean oppressor]</font> is?

<p><sup>14</sup> Why do You make men like the fish of the sea, like reptiles <i>and</i> creeping things that have no ruler <font color='#7a8080'>[and are defenseless against their foes]</font>?

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Chaldean]</font> brings all of them up with his hook; he catches and drags them out with his net, he gathers them in his dragnet; so he rejoices and is in high spirits.

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore he sacrifices <font color='#7a8080'>[offerings]</font> to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, because from them he lives luxuriously and his food is plentiful <i>and</i> rich.

<p><sup>17</sup> Shall he therefore continue to empty his net and mercilessly go on slaying the nations forever?

<h4>2</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Oh, I know, I have been rash to talk out plainly this way to God!]</font> I will <font color='#7a8080'>[in my thinking]</font> stand upon my post of observation and station myself on the tower <i>or</i> fortress, and will watch to see what He will say within me and what answer I will make <font color='#7a8080'>[as His mouthpiece]</font> to the perplexities of my complaint against Him.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the Lord answered me and said, Write the vision and engrave it so plainly upon tablets that everyone who passes may <font color='#7a8080'>[be able to]</font> read <font color='#7a8080'>[it easily and quickly]</font> as he hastens by.

<p><sup>3</sup> For the vision is yet for an appointed time and it hastens to the end <font color='#7a8080'>[fulfillment]</font>; it will not deceive <i>or</i> disappoint. Though it tarry, wait <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> for it, because it will surely come; it will not be behindhand on its appointed day.

<p><sup>4</sup> Look at the proud; his soul is not straight <i>or</i> right within him, but the <font color='#7a8080'>[rigidly]</font> just <i>and</i> the <font color='#7a8080'>[uncompromisingly]</font> righteous man shall live by his faith <i>and</i> in his faithfulness.

<p><sup>5</sup> Moreover, wine <i>and</i> <i>wealth</i> are treacherous; the proud man <font color='#7a8080'>[the Chaldean invader]</font> is restless <i>and</i> cannot stay at home. His appetite is large like that of Sheol and <font color='#7a8080'>[his greed]</font> is like death and cannot be satisfied; he gathers to himself all nations and collects all people as if he owned them.

<p><sup>6</sup> Shall not all these <font color='#7a8080'>[victims of his greed]</font> take up a taunt against him and in scoffing derision of him say, Woe to him who piles up that which is not his! <font color='#7a8080'>[How long will he possess it?]</font> And <font color='#7a8080'>[woe to him]</font> who loads himself with promissory notes for usury!

<p><sup>7</sup> Shall <font color='#7a8080'>[your debtors]</font> not rise up suddenly who shall bite you, exacting usury of you, and those awake who will vex you <font color='#7a8080'>[toss you to and fro and make you tremble violently]</font>? Then you will be booty for them.

<p><sup>8</sup> Because you <font color='#7a8080'>[king of Babylon]</font> have plundered many nations, all who are left of the people shall plunder youâ€”because of men's blood and for the violence done to the earth, to the city and all the people who live in each city.

<p><sup>9</sup> Woe to him who obtains wicked gain for his house, <font color='#7a8080'>[who thinks by so doing]</font> to set his nest on high that he may be preserved from calamity <i>and</i> delivered from the power of evil!

<p><sup>10</sup> You have devised shame to your house by cutting off <i>and</i> putting an end to many peoples, and you have sinned against <i>and</i> forfeited your own life.

<p><sup>11</sup> For the stone shall cry out of the wall <font color='#7a8080'>[built in sin, to accuse you]</font>, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it <font color='#7a8080'>[agreeing with its charge against you]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> Woe to him who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity!

<p><sup>13</sup> Behold, is it not by appointment of the Lord of hosts that the nations toil only to satisfy the fire <font color='#7a8080'>[that will consume their work]</font>, and the peoples weary themselves only for emptiness, falsity, <i>and</i> futility?

<p><sup>14</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[the time is coming when]</font> the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

<p><sup>15</sup> Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink, who pours out your bottle to them <i>and</i> adds to it your poisonous <i>and</i> blighting wrath and also makes them drunk, that you may look on their stripped condition <i>and</i> pour out foul shame <font color='#7a8080'>[on their glory]</font>!

<p><sup>16</sup> You <font color='#7a8080'>[yourself]</font> will be filled with shame <i>and</i> contempt instead of glory. Drink also and be like an uncircumcised <font color='#7a8080'>[heathen]</font>! The cup <font color='#7a8080'>[of wrath]</font> in the Lord's right hand will come around to you <font color='#7a8080'>[O destroyer]</font>, and foul shame shall be upon your own glory!

<p><sup>17</sup> For the violence done to Lebanon will cover <i>and</i> overwhelm you; the destruction of the animals <font color='#7a8080'>[which the violence frightened away]</font> will terrify you on account of men's blood and the violence done to the land, to the city and all its inhabitants.

<p><sup>18</sup> What profit is the graven image when its maker has formed it? It is only a molten image and a teacher of lies. For the maker trusts in his own creations <font color='#7a8080'>[as his gods]</font> when he makes dumb idols.

<p><sup>19</sup> Woe to him who says to the wooden image, Awake! and to the dumb stone, Arise, teach! <font color='#7a8080'>[Yet, it cannot, for]</font> behold, it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all inside it!

<p><sup>20</sup> But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth hush <i>and</i> keep silence before Him.

<h4>3</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to wild, enthusiastic, <i>and</i> triumphal music.

<p><sup>2</sup> O Lord, I have heard the report of You and was afraid. O Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make <font color='#7a8080'>[Yourself]</font> known! In wrath <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember love, pity, <i>and</i> mercy.

<p><sup>3</sup> God <font color='#7a8080'>[approaching from Sinai]</font> came from Teman <font color='#7a8080'>[which represents Edom]</font> and the Holy One from Mount Paran <font color='#7a8080'>[in the Sinai region]</font>. Selah <font color='#7a8080'>[pause, and calmly think of that]</font>! His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of His praise.

<p><sup>4</sup> And His brightness was like the sunlight; rays streamed from His hand, and there <font color='#7a8080'>[in the sunlike splendor]</font> was the hiding place of His power.

<p><sup>5</sup> Before Him went the pestilence <font color='#7a8080'>[as in Egypt]</font>, and burning plague followed His feet <font color='#7a8080'>[as in Sennacherib's army]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook the nations, and the eternal mountains were scattered and the perpetual hills bowed low. His ways are everlasting <i>and</i> His goings are of old.

<p><sup>7</sup> I <font color='#7a8080'>[Habakkuk, in vision]</font> saw the tents of Cushan <font color='#7a8080'>[probably Ethiopia]</font> in affliction; the <font color='#7a8080'>[tent]</font> curtains of the land of Midian trembled.

<p><sup>8</sup> Were You displeased with the rivers, O Lord? Or was Your anger against the rivers <font color='#7a8080'>[You divided]</font>? Was Your wrath against the <font color='#7a8080'>[Red]</font> Sea, that You rode <font color='#7a8080'>[before]</font> upon Your horses and Your chariots of victory <i>and</i> deliverance?

<p><sup>9</sup> Your bow was made quite bare; sworn to the tribes <font color='#7a8080'>[of Israel]</font> by Your sure word were the rods of chastisement, scourges, <i>and</i> calamities. Selah <font color='#7a8080'>[pause, and calmly think of that]</font>! With rivers You cleaved the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[bringing forth waters in dry places]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> The mountains saw You; they trembled <i>and</i> writhed <font color='#7a8080'>[as if in pain]</font>. The overflowing of the water passed by <font color='#7a8080'>[as at the deluge]</font>; the deep uttered its voice and lifted its hands on high.

<p><sup>11</sup> The sun and moon stood back <font color='#7a8080'>[as before Joshua]</font> in their habitation at the light of Your arrows as they sped, at the flash of Your glittering spear.

<p><sup>12</sup> You marched through the land in indignation; You trampled <i>and</i> threshed the nations in anger.

<p><sup>13</sup> You went forth <i>and</i> have come for the salvation of Your people, for the deliverance <i>and</i> victory of Your anointed <font color='#7a8080'>[people Israel]</font>; You smote the head of the house of the wicked, laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah <font color='#7a8080'>[pause, and calmly think of that]</font>!

<p><sup>14</sup> You pierced with his own arrows the head of <font color='#7a8080'>[the enemy's]</font> hordes; they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me <font color='#7a8080'>[the people]</font>, rejoicing as if to devour the poor <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> secretly.

<p><sup>15</sup> You have trodden the sea with Your horses, <font color='#7a8080'>[beside]</font> the heap of great <i>and</i> surging waters.

<p><sup>16</sup> I heard and my <font color='#7a8080'>[whole inner self]</font> trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness enters into my bones and under me <font color='#7a8080'>[down to my feet]</font>; I tremble. I will wait quietly for the day of trouble and distress when there shall come up against <font color='#7a8080'>[my]</font> people him who is about to invade <i>and</i> oppress them.

<p><sup>17</sup> Though the fig tree does not blossom and there is no fruit on the vines, <font color='#7a8080'>[though]</font> the product of the olive fails and the fields yield no food, though the flock is cut off from the fold and there are no cattle in the stalls,

<p><sup>18</sup> Yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will exult in the <font color='#7a8080'>[victorious]</font> God of my salvation!

<p><sup>19</sup> The Lord God is my Strength, my personal bravery, <i>and</i> my invincible army; He makes my feet like hinds' feet and will make me to walk <font color='#7a8080'>[not to stand still in terror, but to walk]</font> <i>and</i> make <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> progress upon my high places <font color='#7a8080'>[of trouble, suffering, or responsibility]</font>!For the Chief Musician; with my stringed instruments.
