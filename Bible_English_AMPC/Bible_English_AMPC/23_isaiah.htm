<h4>1</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The vision <font color='#7a8080'>[seen by spiritual perception]</font> of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[the kingdom]</font> and Jerusalem <font color='#7a8080'>[its capital]</font> in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<p><sup>2</sup> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the Lord has spoken: I have nourished and brought up sons <i>and</i> have made them great and exalted, but they have rebelled against Me <i>and</i> broken away from Me.

<p><sup>3</sup> The ox <font color='#7a8080'>[instinctively]</font> knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib, but Israel does not know <i>or</i> recognize Me <font color='#7a8080'>[as Lord]</font>, My people do not consider <i>or</i> understand.

<p><sup>4</sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the Lord, they have despised <i>and</i> shown contempt <i>and</i> provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they have become utterly estranged (alienated).

<p><sup>5</sup> Why should you be stricken <i>and</i> punished any more <font color='#7a8080'>[since it brings no correction]</font>? You will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint (feeble, sick, and nauseated).

<p><sup>6</sup> From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness <i>or</i> health in <font color='#7a8080'>[the nation's body]</font>—but wounds and bruises and fresh <i>and</i> bleeding stripes; they have not been pressed out <i>and</i> closed up or bound up or softened with oil. <font color='#7a8080'>[No one has troubled to seek a remedy.]</font>

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Because of your detestable disobedience]</font> your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; your land—strangers devour it in your very presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by aliens.

<p><sup>8</sup> And the Daughter of Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> is left like a <font color='#7a8080'>[deserted]</font> booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, like a besieged city <font color='#7a8080'>[spared, but in the midst of desolation]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> Except the Lord of hosts had left us a very small remnant <font color='#7a8080'>[of survivors]</font>, we should have been like Sodom, and we should have been like Gomorrah.

<p><sup>10</sup> Hear <font color='#7a8080'>[O Jerusalem]</font> the word of the Lord, you rulers <i>or</i> judges of <font color='#7a8080'>[another]</font> Sodom! Give ear to the law <i>and</i> the teaching of our God, you people of <font color='#7a8080'>[another]</font> Gomorrah!

<p><sup>11</sup> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me <font color='#7a8080'>[unless they are the offering of the heart]</font>? says the Lord. I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts <font color='#7a8080'>[without obedience]</font>; and I do not delight in the blood of bulls or of lambs or of he-goats <font color='#7a8080'>[without righteousness]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> When you come to appear before Me, who requires of you that your <font color='#7a8080'>[unholy feet]</font> trample My courts?

<p><sup>13</sup> Bring no more offerings of vanity (emptiness, falsity, vainglory, and futility); <font color='#7a8080'>[your hollow offering of]</font> incense is an abomination to Me; the New Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure—<font color='#7a8080'>[it is]</font> iniquity <i>and</i> profanation, even the solemn meeting.

<p><sup>14</sup> Your New Moon festivals and your <font color='#7a8080'>[hypocritical]</font> appointed feasts My soul hates. They are an oppressive burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.

<p><sup>15</sup> And when you spread forth your hands <font color='#7a8080'>[in prayer, imploring help]</font>, I will hide My eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood!

<p><sup>16</sup> Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes! Cease to do evil,

<p><sup>17</sup> Learn to do right! Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, <i>and</i> correct the oppressor. Defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.

<p><sup>18</sup> Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord. Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.

<p><sup>19</sup> If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;

<p><sup>20</sup> But if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.

<p><sup>21</sup> How the faithful city has become an <font color='#7a8080'>[idolatrous]</font> harlot, she who was full of justice! Uprightness <i>and</i> right standing with God <font color='#7a8080'>[once]</font> lodged in her—but now murderers.

<p><sup>22</sup> Your silver has become dross, your wine is mixed with water.

<p><sup>23</sup> Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves; everyone loves bribes and runs after compensation <i>and</i> rewards. They judge not for the fatherless <i>nor</i> defend them, neither does the cause of the widow come to them <font color='#7a8080'>[for they delay or turn a deaf ear]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> Therefore says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will appease Myself on My adversaries and avenge Myself on My enemies.

<p><sup>25</sup> And I will bring My hand again upon you and thoroughly purge away your dross <font color='#7a8080'>[as with lye]</font> and take away all your tin <i>or</i> alloy.

<p><sup>26</sup> And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning; afterward you shall be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.

<p><sup>27</sup> Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her <font color='#7a8080'>[returned]</font> converts with righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God).

<p><sup>28</sup> But the crushing <i>and</i> destruction of rebels and sinners shall be together, and they who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.

<p><sup>29</sup> For you will be ashamed <font color='#7a8080'>[of the folly and degradation]</font> of the oak <i>or</i> terebinth trees in which you found <font color='#7a8080'>[idolatrous]</font> pleasure, and you will blush with shame for the <font color='#7a8080'>[idolatrous worship which you practice in the passion-inflaming]</font> gardens which you have chosen.

<p><sup>30</sup> For you shall be like an oak <i>or</i> terebinth whose leaf withers, and like a garden that has no water.

<p><sup>31</sup> And the strong shall become like tow <i>and</i> become tinder, and his work like a spark, and they shall both burn together, with none to quench them.

<h4>2</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The word which Isaiah son of Amoz saw <font color='#7a8080'>[revealed]</font> concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

<p><sup>2</sup> It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be <font color='#7a8080'>[firmly]</font> established as the highest of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow to it.

<p><sup>3</sup> And many people shall come and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us His ways and that we may walk in His paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law <i>and</i> instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

<p><sup>4</sup> And He shall judge between the nations and shall decide <font color='#7a8080'>[disputes]</font> for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

<p><sup>5</sup> O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord.

<p><sup>6</sup> Surely <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord]</font> You have rejected <i>and</i> forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled <font color='#7a8080'>[with customs]</font> from the east and with soothsayers <font color='#7a8080'>[who foretell]</font> like the Philistines; also they strike hands <i>and</i> make pledges <i>and</i> agreements with the children of aliens.

<p><sup>7</sup> Their land also is full of silver and gold; neither is there any end to their treasures. Their land is also full of horses; neither is there any end to their chariots.

<p><sup>8</sup> Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, what their own fingers have made.

<p><sup>9</sup> And the common man is bowed down <font color='#7a8080'>[before idols]</font>, also the great man is brought low <i>and</i> humbles himself—therefore forgive them not <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dust from before the terror of the Lord and from the glory of His majesty.

<p><sup>11</sup> The proud looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.

<p><sup>12</sup> For there shall be a day of the Lord of hosts against all who are proud and haughty and against all who are lifted up—and they shall be brought low—

<p><sup>13</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The wrath of God will begin by coming down]</font> against all the cedars of Lebanon <font color='#7a8080'>[west of the Jordan]</font> that are high and lifted up, and against all the oaks of Bashan <font color='#7a8080'>[east of the Jordan]</font>,

<p><sup>14</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[after that]</font> against all the high mountains and all the hills that are lifted up,

<p><sup>15</sup> And against every high tower and every fenced wall,

<p><sup>16</sup> And against all the ships of Tarshish and all the picturesque <i>and</i> desirable imagery <font color='#7a8080'>[designed for mere ornament and luxury]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> Then the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.

<p><sup>18</sup> And the idols shall utterly pass away (be abolished).

<p><sup>19</sup> Then shall <font color='#7a8080'>[the stricken, deprived of all in which they had trusted]</font> go into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth from before the terror <i>and</i> dread of the Lord and from before the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake mightily <i>and</i> terribly the earth.

<p><sup>20</sup> In that day men shall cast away to the moles and to the bats their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship,

<p><sup>21</sup> To go into the caverns of the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks from before the terror <i>and</i> dread of the Lord and from before the glory of His majesty, when He rises to shake mightily <i>and</i> terribly the earth.

<p><sup>22</sup> Cease to trust in <font color='#7a8080'>[weak, frail, and dying]</font> man, whose breath is in his nostrils <font color='#7a8080'>[for so short a time]</font>; in what sense can he be counted as having intrinsic worth?

<h4>3</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff <font color='#7a8080'>[every kind of prop]</font>, the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water,

<p><sup>2</sup> The mighty man and the man of war, the judge <i>and</i> the <font color='#7a8080'>[professional]</font> prophet, the one who foretells by divination and the old man,

<p><sup>3</sup> The captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor and the expert craftsman and the skillful enchanter.

<p><sup>4</sup> And I will make boys their princes, and with childishness shall they rule over them <font color='#7a8080'>[with outrage instead of justice]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> And the people shall be oppressed, each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; the child shall behave himself proudly <i>and</i> with insolence against the old man, and the lowborn against the honorable <font color='#7a8080'>[person of rank]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, You have a robe, you shall be our judge <i>and</i> ruler, and this heap of ruins shall be under your control—

<p><sup>7</sup> In that day he will answer, saying, I will not be a healer <i>and</i> one who binds up; <i>I am not a physician</i>. For in my house is neither bread nor clothing; you shall not make me judge <i>and</i> ruler of the people.

<p><sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah is fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of His glory <i>and</i> defy His glorious presence.

<p><sup>9</sup> Their respecting of persons <i>and</i> showing of partiality witnesses against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil <font color='#7a8080'>[as a reward upon themselves]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.

<p><sup>11</sup> Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with them, for what their hands have done shall be done to them.

<p><sup>12</sup> As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O My people, your leaders cause you to err, and they confuse (destroy and swallow up) the course of your paths.

<p><sup>13</sup> The Lord stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples <i>and</i> His people.

<p><sup>14</sup> The Lord enters into judgment with the elders of His people and their princes: For <font color='#7a8080'>[by your exactions and oppressions you have robbed the people and ruined the country]</font> you have devoured the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

<p><sup>15</sup> What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the faces of the poor? says the Lord God of hosts.

<p><sup>16</sup> Moreover, the Lord said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks and with undisciplined (flirtatious and alluring) eyes, tripping along with mincing <i>and</i> affected gait, and making a tinkling noise with <font color='#7a8080'>[the anklets on]</font> their feet,

<p><sup>17</sup> Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[making them bald]</font>, and the Lord will cause them to be <font color='#7a8080'>[taken as captives and to suffer the indignity of being]</font> stripped naked.

<p><sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their tinkling anklets, the caps of network, the crescent head ornaments,

<p><sup>19</sup> The pendants, the bracelets <i>or</i> chains, and the spangled face veils <i>and</i> scarfs,

<p><sup>20</sup> The headbands, the short ankle chains <font color='#7a8080'>[attached from one foot to the other to insure a measured gait]</font>, the sashes, the perfume boxes, the amulets <i>or</i> charms <font color='#7a8080'>[suspended from the ears or neck]</font>,

<p><sup>21</sup> The signet rings and nose rings,

<p><sup>22</sup> The festal robes, the cloaks, the stoles <i>and</i> shawls, and the handbags,

<p><sup>23</sup> The hand mirrors, the fine linen <font color='#7a8080'>[undergarments]</font>, the turbans, and the <font color='#7a8080'>[whole body-enveloping]</font> veils.

<p><sup>24</sup> And it shall come to pass that instead of the sweet odor of spices there shall be the stench of rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; and searing <font color='#7a8080'>[of captives by the scorching heat]</font> instead of beauty.

<p><sup>25</sup> Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty men in battle.

<p><sup>26</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem's]</font> gates shall lament and mourn <font color='#7a8080'>[as those who wail for the dead]</font>; and she, being ruined <i>and</i> desolate, shall sit upon the ground.

<h4>4</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and provide our own apparel; only let us be called by your name to take away our reproach <font color='#7a8080'>[of being unmarried]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> In that day the Branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and lovely to those of Israel who have escaped.

<p><sup>3</sup> And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem <i>and for</i> <i>eternal life</i>,

<p><sup>4</sup> After the Lord has washed away the <font color='#7a8080'>[moral]</font> filth of the daughters of Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[pride, vanity, haughtiness]</font> and has purged the bloodstains of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit <i>and</i> blast of judgment and by the spirit <i>and</i> blast of burning <i>and</i> sifting.

<p><sup>5</sup> And the Lord will create over the whole site, over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy (a defense of divine love and protection).

<p><sup>6</sup> And there shall be a pavilion for shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge and a shelter from storm and from rain.

<h4>5</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Let me <font color='#7a8080'>[as God's representative]</font> sing of <i>and</i> for my greatly Beloved <font color='#7a8080'>[God, the Son]</font> a tender song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard <font color='#7a8080'>[His chosen people]</font>. My greatly Beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.

<p><sup>2</sup> And He dug <i>and</i> trenched the ground and gathered out the stones from it and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and hewed out a winepress in it. And He looked for it to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

<p><sup>3</sup> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between Me and My vineyard <font color='#7a8080'>[My people, says the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> What more could have been done for My vineyard that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to bring forth grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?

<p><sup>5</sup> And now I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten <i>and</i> burned up; and I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down <font color='#7a8080'>[by enemies]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned or cultivated, but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

<p><sup>7</sup> For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant planting <font color='#7a8080'>[the plant of His delight]</font>. And He looked for justice, but behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[He saw]</font> oppression <i>and</i> bloodshed; <font color='#7a8080'>[He looked]</font> for righteousness (for uprightness and right standing with God), but behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[He heard]</font> a cry <font color='#7a8080'>[of oppression and distress]</font>!

<p><sup>8</sup> Woe to those who join house to house <font color='#7a8080'>[and by violently expelling the poorer occupants enclose large acreage]</font> and join field to field until there is no place for others and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!

<p><sup>9</sup> In my <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah's]</font> ears the Lord of hosts said, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and beautiful ones shall be without inhabitant.

<p><sup>10</sup> For ten acres of vineyard shall yield only about eight gallons, and ten bushels of seed will produce but one bushel.

<p><sup>11</sup> Woe unto those who rise early in the morning, that they may pursue strong drink, who tarry late into the night till wine inflames them!

<p><sup>12</sup> They have lyre and harp, tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts, but they do not regard the deeds of the Lord, neither do they consider the operation of His hands <font color='#7a8080'>[in mercy and in judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore My people go into captivity <font color='#7a8080'>[to their enemies]</font> without knowing it <i>and</i> because they have no knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[of God]</font>. And their honorable men <font color='#7a8080'>[their glory]</font> are famished, and their common people are parched with thirst.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore Sheol (the unseen state, the realm of the dead) has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth without measure; and <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem's]</font> nobility <i>and</i> her multitude and her pomp <i>and</i> tumult and <font color='#7a8080'>[the drunken reveler]</font> who exults in her descend into it.

<p><sup>15</sup> And the common man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.

<p><sup>16</sup> But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice, and God, the Holy One, shows Himself holy in righteousness <i>and</i> through righteous judgments.

<p><sup>17</sup> Then shall the lambs feed <font color='#7a8080'>[among the ruins]</font> as in their own pasture, and <font color='#7a8080'>[among]</font> the desolate places of the <font color='#7a8080'>[exiled]</font> rich shall sojourners <i>and</i> aliens eat.

<p><sup>18</sup> Woe to those who draw <font color='#7a8080'>[calamity]</font> with cords of iniquity <i>and</i> falsehood, who bring punishment to themselves with a cart rope of wickedness,

<p><sup>19</sup> Who say, Let <font color='#7a8080'>[the Holy One]</font> make haste <i>and</i> speed His <font color='#7a8080'>[prophesied]</font> vengeance, that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!

<p><sup>20</sup> Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

<p><sup>21</sup> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and prudent <i>and</i> shrewd in their own sight!

<p><sup>22</sup> Woe to those who are mighty heroes at drinking wine and men of strength in mixing alcoholic drinks!—

<p><sup>23</sup> Who justify <i>and</i> acquit the guilty for a bribe, but take away the rights of the innocent <i>and</i> righteous from them!

<p><sup>24</sup> Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be like rottenness and their blossom shall go up like fine dust—because they have rejected <i>and</i> cast away the law <i>and</i> the teaching of the Lord of hosts and have not believed <i>but</i> have treated scornfully <i>and</i> have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>25</sup> Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against His people, and He has stretched forth His hand against them and has smitten them. And the mountains trembled, and their dead bodies were like dung <i>and</i> sweepings in the midst of the streets. For all this, His anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out <font color='#7a8080'>[in judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> And He will lift up a signal to call together a hostile people from afar <font color='#7a8080'>[to execute His judgment on Judea]</font>, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[as bees are hissed from their hives]</font>, and behold, they shall come with speed, swiftly!

<p><sup>27</sup> None is weary or stumbles among them, none slumbers or sleeps; nor is the girdle of their loins loosed or the latchet (thong) of their shoes broken;

<p><sup>28</sup> Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.

<p><sup>29</sup> Their roaring is like that of a lioness, they roar like young lions; they growl and seize their prey and carry it safely away, and there is none to deliver it.

<p><sup>30</sup> And in that day they <font color='#7a8080'>[the army from afar]</font> shall roar against <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jews]</font> like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness and distress; and the light <font color='#7a8080'>[itself]</font> will be darkened by the clouds of it.

<h4>6</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the year that King Uzziah died, <font color='#7a8080'>[in a vision]</font> I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and the skirts of His train filled the <font color='#7a8080'>[most holy part of the]</font> temple.

<p><sup>2</sup> Above Him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two <font color='#7a8080'>[each]</font> covered his <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> face, and with two <font color='#7a8080'>[each]</font> covered his feet, and with two <font color='#7a8080'>[each]</font> flew.

<p><sup>3</sup> And one cried to another and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!

<p><sup>4</sup> And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then said I, Woe is me! For I am undone <i>and</i> ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!

<p><sup>6</sup> Then flew one of the seraphim <font color='#7a8080'>[heavenly beings]</font> to me, having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with tongs from off the altar;

<p><sup>7</sup> And with it he touched my mouth and said, Behold, this has touched your lips; your iniquity <i>and</i> guilt are taken away, and your sin is completely atoned for <i>and</i> forgiven.

<p><sup>8</sup> Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? And who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

<p><sup>9</sup> And He said, Go and tell this people, Hear <i>and</i> hear continually, but understand not; and see <i>and</i> see continually, but do not apprehend with your mind.

<p><sup>10</sup> Make the heart of this people fat; and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn again and be healed.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then said I, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without man, and the land is utterly desolate,

<p><sup>12</sup> And the Lord removes <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.

<p><sup>13</sup> And though a tenth <font color='#7a8080'>[of the people]</font> remain in the land, it will be for their destruction <font color='#7a8080'>[eaten up and burned]</font> like a terebinth tree or like an oak whose stump <i>and</i> substance remain when they are felled <i>or</i> have cast their leaves. The holy seed <font color='#7a8080'>[the elect remnant]</font> is the stump <i>and</i> substance <font color='#7a8080'>[of Israel]</font>.

<h4>7</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not conquer it.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the house of David <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font> was told, Syria is allied with Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>. And the heart <font color='#7a8080'>[of Ahaz]</font> and the hearts of his people trembled <i>and</i> shook, as the trees of the forest tremble <i>and</i> shake with the wind.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then said the Lord to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet <i>Judah's King</i> Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub <font color='#7a8080'>[a remnant shall return]</font>, at the end of the aqueduct <i>or</i> canal of the Upper Pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field;

<p><sup>4</sup> And say to him, Take heed and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted because of these two stumps of smoking firebrands—at the fierce anger of <font color='#7a8080'>[the Syrian King]</font> Rezin and Syria and of the son of Remaliah <font color='#7a8080'>[Pekah, usurper of the throne of Israel]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> Because Syria, Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>, and the son of Remaliah have purposed evil against you <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font>, saying,

<p><sup>6</sup> Let us go up against Judah and harass <i>and</i> terrify it; and let us cleave it asunder <font color='#7a8080'>[each of us taking a portion]</font>, and set a <font color='#7a8080'>[vassal]</font> king in the midst of it, namely the son of Tabeel,

<p><sup>7</sup> Thus says the Lord God: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.

<p><sup>8</sup> For the head <font color='#7a8080'>[the capital]</font> of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is <font color='#7a8080'>[King]</font> Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.

<p><sup>9</sup> And the head (the capital) of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son <font color='#7a8080'>[Pekah]</font>. If you will not believe <i>and</i> trust <i>and</i> rely <font color='#7a8080'>[on God and on the words of God's prophet instead of Assyria]</font>, surely you will not be established <i>nor</i> will you remain.

<p><sup>10</sup> Moreover, the Lord spoke again to King Ahaz, saying,

<p><sup>11</sup> Ask for yourself a sign (a token or proof) of the Lord your God <font color='#7a8080'>[one that will convince you that God has spoken and will keep His word]</font>; ask it either in the depth below or in the height above <font color='#7a8080'>[let it be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.

<p><sup>13</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah]</font> said, Hear then, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary <i>and</i> try the patience of men, but will you weary <i>and</i> try the patience of my God also?

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, the young woman who is unmarried <i>and</i> a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel <font color='#7a8080'>[God with us]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> Butter <i>and</i> curds and wild honey shall he eat when he knows <font color='#7a8080'>[enough]</font> to refuse the evil and choose the good.

<p><sup>16</sup> For before the child shall know <font color='#7a8080'>[enough]</font> to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land <font color='#7a8080'>[Canaan]</font> whose two kings you abhor <i>and</i> of whom you are in sickening dread shall be forsaken <font color='#7a8080'>[both Ephraim and Syria]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> The Lord shall bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[the ten northern tribes]</font> departed from Judah—even the king of Assyria.

<p><sup>18</sup> And in that day the Lord shall whistle for the fly <font color='#7a8080'>[the numerous and troublesome foe]</font> that is in the whole extent of the canal country of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

<p><sup>19</sup> And these <font color='#7a8080'>[enemies like flies and bees]</font> shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate <i>and</i> rugged valleys <i>and</i> deep ravines and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes and on all the pastures.

<p><sup>20</sup> In the same day <font color='#7a8080'>[will the people of Judah be utterly stripped of belongings]</font>, the Lord will shave with the razor that is hired from the parts beyond the River <font color='#7a8080'>[Euphrates]</font>—even with the king of Assyria—<font color='#7a8080'>[that razor will shave]</font> the head and the hair of the legs, and it shall also consume the beard <font color='#7a8080'>[leaving Judah with open shame and scorn]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[because of the desolation brought on by the invaders]</font> in that day, a man will <font color='#7a8080'>[be so poor that he will]</font> keep alive only a young milk cow and two sheep.

<p><sup>22</sup> And because of the abundance of milk that they will give, he will eat butter <i>and</i> curds, for <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> butter <i>and</i> curds and <font color='#7a8080'>[wild]</font> honey <font color='#7a8080'>[no vegetables]</font> shall everyone eat who is left in the land <font color='#7a8080'>[these products provided from the extensive pastures and the plentiful wild flowers upon which the bees depend]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> And in that day, in every place where there used to be a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be briers and thorns.

<p><sup>24</sup> With arrows and with bows shall a man come <font color='#7a8080'>[to hunt]</font> there, because all the land will be briers and thorns.

<p><sup>25</sup> And as for all the hills that were formerly cultivated with mattock <i>and</i> hoe, you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where oxen are let loose to pasture and where sheep tread.

<h4>8</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then the Lord said to me, Take a large tablet <font color='#7a8080'>[of wood, metal, or stone]</font> and write upon it with a graving tool <i>and</i> in ordinary characters <font color='#7a8080'>[which the humblest man can read]</font>: Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz <font color='#7a8080'>[they (the Assyrians) hasten to the spoil (of Syria and Israel), they speed to the prey]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> And I took faithful witnesses to record <i>and</i> attest <font color='#7a8080'>[this prophecy]</font> for me, Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.

<p><sup>3</sup> And I approached <font color='#7a8080'>[my wife]</font> the prophetess, and when she had conceived and borne a son, the Lord said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz <font color='#7a8080'>[as a continual reminder to the people of the prophecy]</font>,

<p><sup>4</sup> For before the child knows how to say, My father or my mother, the riches of Damascus <font color='#7a8080'>[Syria's capital]</font> and the spoil of Samaria <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel's capital]</font> shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.

<p><sup>5</sup> The Lord spoke to me yet again and said,

<p><sup>6</sup> Because this people <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel and Judah]</font> have refused <i>and</i> despised the waters of Shiloah <font color='#7a8080'>[Siloam, the only perennial fountain of Jerusalem, and symbolic of God's protection and sustaining power]</font> that go gently, and rejoice in <i>and</i> with Rezin <font color='#7a8080'>[the king of Syria]</font> and Remaliah's son <font color='#7a8080'>[Pekah the king of Israel]</font>,

<p><sup>7</sup> Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the waters of the River <font color='#7a8080'>[Euphrates]</font>, strong and many—even the king of Assyria and all the glory <font color='#7a8080'>[of his gorgeous retinue]</font>; and it will rise over all its channels, brooks, valleys, <i>and</i> canals and extend far beyond its banks;

<p><sup>8</sup> And it will sweep on into Judah; it will overflow <i>and</i> go over <font color='#7a8080'>[the hills]</font>, reaching even <font color='#7a8080'>[but only]</font> to the neck <font color='#7a8080'>[of which Jerusalem is the head]</font>, and the outstretched wings <font color='#7a8080'>[of the armies of Assyria]</font> shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel <font color='#7a8080'>[Messiah, God is with us]</font>!

<p><sup>9</sup> Make an uproar <i>and</i> be broken in pieces, O you peoples <font color='#7a8080'>[rage, raise the war cry, do your worst, and be utterly dismayed]</font>! Give ear, all you <font color='#7a8080'>[our enemies]</font> <i>of</i> far countries. Gird yourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[for war]</font>, and be thrown into consternation! Gird yourselves, and be <font color='#7a8080'>[utterly]</font> dismayed!

<p><sup>10</sup> Take counsel together <font color='#7a8080'>[against Judah]</font>, but it shall come to nought; speak the word, but it will not stand, for God is with us <font color='#7a8080'>[Immanuel]</font>!

<p><sup>11</sup> For the Lord spoke thus to me with His strong hand <font color='#7a8080'>[upon me]</font>, and warned <i>and</i> instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,

<p><sup>12</sup> Do not call conspiracy <font color='#7a8080'>[or hard, or holy]</font> all that this people will call conspiracy <font color='#7a8080'>[or hard, or holy]</font>; neither be in fear of what they fear, nor <font color='#7a8080'>[make others afraid and]</font> in dread.

<p><sup>13</sup> The Lord of hosts—regard Him as holy <i>and</i> honor His holy name <font color='#7a8080'>[by regarding Him as your only hope of safety]</font>, and let Him be your fear and let Him be your dread <font color='#7a8080'>[lest you offend Him by your fear of man and distrust of Him]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> And He shall be a sanctuary <font color='#7a8080'>[a sacred and indestructible asylum to those who reverently fear and trust in Him]</font>; but He shall be a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>15</sup> And many among them shall stumble thereon; and they shall fall and be broken, and be snared and taken.

<p><sup>16</sup> Bind up the testimony, seal the law <i>and</i> the teaching among my <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah's]</font> disciples.

<p><sup>17</sup> And I will wait for the Lord, Who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for <i>and</i> hope in Him.

<p><sup>18</sup> Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and wonders <font color='#7a8080'>[that are to take place]</font> in Israel from the Lord of hosts, Who dwells on Mount Zion.

<p><sup>19</sup> And when the people <font color='#7a8080'>[instead of putting their trust in God]</font> shall say to you, Consult for direction mediums and wizards who chirp and mutter, should not a people seek <i>and</i> consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?

<p><sup>20</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Direct such people]</font> to the teaching and to the testimony! If their teachings are not in accord with this word, it is surely because there is no dawn <i>and</i> no morning for them.

<p><sup>21</sup> And they <font color='#7a8080'>[who consult mediums and wizards]</font> shall pass through <font color='#7a8080'>[the land]</font> sorely distressed and hungry; and when they are hungry, they will fret, and will curse by their king and their God; and whether they look upward

<p><sup>22</sup> Or look to the earth, they will behold only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and into thick darkness <i>and</i> widespread, obscure night they shall be driven away.

<h4>9</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[in the midst of judgment there is the promise and the certainty of the Lord's deliverance and]</font> there shall be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time He will make it glorious, by the way of the Sea <font color='#7a8080'>[of Galilee, the land]</font> beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

<p><sup>2</sup> The people who walked in darkness have seen a great Light; those who dwelt in the land of intense darkness <i>and</i> the shadow of death, upon them has the Light shined.

<p><sup>3</sup> You <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> have multiplied the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before You like the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil <font color='#7a8080'>[of battle]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> For the yoke of <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel's]</font> burden, and the staff <i>or</i> rod for <font color='#7a8080'>[goading]</font> their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, You have broken as in the day of <font color='#7a8080'>[Gideon with]</font> Midian.

<p><sup>5</sup> For every <font color='#7a8080'>[tramping]</font> warrior's war boots <i>and</i> all his armor in the battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire.

<p><sup>6</sup> For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father <font color='#7a8080'>[of Eternity]</font>, Prince of Peace.

<p><sup>7</sup> Of the increase of His government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from the <font color='#7a8080'>[latter]</font> time forth, even forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.

<p><sup>8</sup> The Lord has sent a word against Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[the ten tribes]</font>, and it has lighted upon Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[the ten tribes, the kingdom of Ephraim]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> And all the people shall know it—even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria <font color='#7a8080'>[its capital]</font>—who said in pride and stoutness of heart,

<p><sup>10</sup> The bricks have fallen, but we will build <font color='#7a8080'>[all the better]</font> with hewn stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put <font color='#7a8080'>[costlier]</font> cedars in their place.

<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore the Lord has stirred up the adversaries <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrians]</font> of Rezin <font color='#7a8080'>[king of Syria]</font> against <font color='#7a8080'>[Ephraim]</font>, and He will stir up their enemies <i>and</i> arm <i>and</i> join them together,

<p><sup>12</sup> The Syrians <font color='#7a8080'>[compelled to fight with their enemies, going]</font> before <font color='#7a8080'>[on the east]</font> and the Philistines behind <font color='#7a8080'>[on the west]</font>; and they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this, <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> anger is not <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> turned away, but His hand is still stretched out <font color='#7a8080'>[in judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Yet the people turn not to Him Who smote them, neither do they seek <font color='#7a8080'>[inquire for or require as their vital need]</font> the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail <font color='#7a8080'>[the highest and the lowest]</font>—<font color='#7a8080'>[high]</font> palm branch and <font color='#7a8080'>[low]</font> rush in one day;

<p><sup>15</sup> The elderly and honored man, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.

<p><sup>16</sup> For they who lead this people cause them to err, and they who are led <font color='#7a8080'>[astray]</font> by them are swallowed up (destroyed).

<p><sup>17</sup> Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will He have compassion on their fatherless and widows, for everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this, <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out <font color='#7a8080'>[in judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> For wickedness burns like a fire; it devours the briers and thorns, and it kindles in the thickets of the forest; they roll upward in a column of smoke.

<p><sup>19</sup> Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is darkened <i>and</i> burned up, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no man spares his brother.

<p><sup>20</sup> They snatch in discord on the right hand, but are still hungry <font color='#7a8080'>[their cruelty not diminished]</font>; and they devour <i>and</i> destroy on the left hand, but are not satisfied. Each devours <i>and</i> destroys his own flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[and blood]</font> <i>or</i> his neighbor's.

<p><sup>21</sup> Manasseh <font color='#7a8080'>[thirsts for the blood of his brother]</font> Ephraim, and Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[for that of]</font> Manasseh; but together they are against Judah. For all this, <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out <font color='#7a8080'>[in judgment]</font>.

<h4>10</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to those <font color='#7a8080'>[judges]</font> who issue unrighteous decrees, and to the magistrates who keep causing unjust <i>and</i> oppressive decisions to be recorded,

<p><sup>2</sup> To turn aside the needy from justice and to make plunder of the rightful claims of the poor of My people, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!

<p><sup>3</sup> And what will you do in the day of visitation <font color='#7a8080'>[of God's wrath]</font>, and in the desolation which shall come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you deposit <font color='#7a8080'>[for safekeeping]</font> your wealth <i>and</i> with whom leave your glory?

<p><sup>4</sup> Without Me they shall bow down among the prisoners, and they shall fall <font color='#7a8080'>[overwhelmed]</font> under the heaps of the slain <font color='#7a8080'>[on the battlefield]</font>. For all this, <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out <font color='#7a8080'>[in judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of My anger, the staff in whose hand is My indignation <i>and</i> fury <font color='#7a8080'>[against Israel's disobedience]</font>!

<p><sup>6</sup> I send <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian]</font> against a hypocritical <i>and</i> godless nation and against the people of My wrath; I command him to take the spoil and to seize the prey and to tread them down like the mire in the streets.

<p><sup>7</sup> However, this is not his intention <font color='#7a8080'>[nor is the Assyrian aware that he is doing this at My bidding]</font>, neither does his mind so think <i>and</i> plan; but it is in his mind to destroy and cut off many nations.

<p><sup>8</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian]</font> says, Are not my officers all either <font color='#7a8080'>[subjugated]</font> kings <i>or</i> their equal?

<p><sup>9</sup> Is not Calno <font color='#7a8080'>[of Babylonia conquered]</font> like Carchemish <font color='#7a8080'>[on the Euphrates]</font>? Is not Hamath <font color='#7a8080'>[in Upper Syria]</font> like Arpad <font color='#7a8080'>[her neighbor]</font>? Is not Samaria <font color='#7a8080'>[in Israel]</font> like Damascus <font color='#7a8080'>[in Syria]</font>? <font color='#7a8080'>[Have any of these cities been able to resist Assyria? Not one!]</font>

<p><sup>10</sup> As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols <font color='#7a8080'>[which were unable to defend them,]</font> whose graven images were more to be feared <i>and</i> dreaded <i>and</i> more mighty than those of Jerusalem and of Samaria—

<p><sup>11</sup> Shall I not be able to do to Jerusalem and her images as I have done to Samaria and her idols? <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Assyrian]</font>

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore when the Lord has completed all His work <font color='#7a8080'>[of chastisement and purification to be executed]</font> on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, it shall be that He will inflict punishment on the fruit <font color='#7a8080'>[the thoughts, words, and deeds]</font> of the stout <i>and</i> arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the haughtiness of his pride.

<p><sup>13</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian king]</font> has said, I have done it solely by the power of my own hand and wisdom, for I have insight <i>and</i> understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples and have robbed their treasures; and like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones <i>and</i> the inhabitants.

<p><sup>14</sup> And my hand has found like a nest the wealth of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved its wing, or that opened its mouth or chirped.

<p><sup>15</sup> Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it back and forth? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift itself up as if it were not wood <font color='#7a8080'>[but a man of God]</font>!

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore will the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send leanness among <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian's]</font> fat ones; and instead of his glory <i>or</i> under it He will kindle a burning like the burning of fire.

<p><sup>17</sup> And the Light of Israel shall become a fire and His Holy One a flame, and it will burn and devour <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian's]</font> thorns and briers in one day.

<p><sup>18</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Lord]</font> will consume the glory of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Assyrian's]</font> forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man pines away <i>or</i> a standard-bearer faints.

<p><sup>19</sup> And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may make a list of them.

<p><sup>20</sup> And it shall be in that day that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more lean upon him who smote them, but will lean upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

<p><sup>21</sup> A remnant will return <font color='#7a8080'>[Shear-jashub, name of Isaiah's son]</font>, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

<p><sup>22</sup> For though your population, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of it will return <font color='#7a8080'>[and survive]</font>. The <font color='#7a8080'>[fully completed]</font> destruction is decreed (decided upon and brought to an issue); it overflows with justice <i>and</i> righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[the infliction of just punishment]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> For the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will make a full end, whatever is determined <i>or</i> decreed <font color='#7a8080'>[in Israel]</font>, in the midst of all the earth.

<p><sup>24</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, O My people who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian, who smites you with a rod and lifts up his staff against you, as <font color='#7a8080'>[the king of]</font> Egypt did.

<p><sup>25</sup> For yet a little while and My indignation against you shall be accomplished, and My anger shall be directed to destruction <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Assyrian]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> And the Lord of hosts shall stir up <i>and</i> brandish a scourge against them as when He smote Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His rod was over the <font color='#7a8080'>[Red]</font> Sea, so shall He lift it up as He did in <font color='#7a8080'>[the flight from]</font> Egypt.

<p><sup>27</sup> And it shall be in that day that the burden of <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian]</font> shall depart from your shoulders, and his yoke from your neck. The yoke shall be destroyed because of fatness <font color='#7a8080'>[which prevents it from going around your neck]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Assyrian with his army comes to Judah]</font>. He arrives at Aiath; he passes through Migron; at Michmash he gets rid of his baggage <font color='#7a8080'>[by storing it]</font>.

<p><sup>29</sup> They go through the pass, they make Geba their camping place for the night; Ramah is afraid <i>and</i> trembles, Gibeah <font color='#7a8080'>[the city]</font> of <font color='#7a8080'>[King]</font> Saul flees.

<p><sup>30</sup> Cry aloud <font color='#7a8080'>[in consternation]</font>, O Daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O Laishah! <font color='#7a8080'>[Answer her]</font> O you poor Anathoth!

<p><sup>31</sup> Madmenah is in flight; the inhabitants of Gebim seize their belongings <i>and</i> make their households flee for safety.

<p><sup>32</sup> This very day <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian]</font> will halt at Nob <font color='#7a8080'>[the city of priests]</font>, shaking his fist at the mountain of the Daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>33</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But just when the Assyrian is in sight of his goal]</font> behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will lop off the beautiful boughs with terrorizing force; the high in stature will be hewn down and the lofty will be brought low.

<p><sup>34</sup> And He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian]</font> with its majestic trees shall fall by the Mighty One <i>and</i> mightily.

<h4>11</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And there shall come forth a Shoot out of the stock of Jesse <font color='#7a8080'>[David's father]</font>, and a Branch out of his roots shall grow <i>and</i> bear fruit.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the reverential <i>and</i> obedient fear of the Lord—

<p><sup>3</sup> And shall make Him of quick understanding, <i>and</i> His delight shall be in the reverential <i>and</i> obedient fear of the Lord. And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, neither decide by the hearing of His ears;

<p><sup>4</sup> But with righteousness <i>and</i> justice shall He judge the poor and decide with fairness for the meek, the poor, <i>and</i> the downtrodden of the earth; and He shall smite the earth <i>and</i> the oppressor with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.

<p><sup>5</sup> And righteousness shall be the girdle of His waist and faithfulness the girdle of His loins.

<p><sup>6</sup> And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatted domestic animal together; and a little child shall lead them.

<p><sup>7</sup> And the cow and the bear shall feed side by side, their young shall lie down together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

<p><sup>8</sup> And the sucking child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.

<p><sup>9</sup> They shall not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

<p><sup>10</sup> And it shall be in that day that the Root of Jesse shall stand as a signal for the peoples; of Him shall the nations inquire <i>and</i> seek knowledge, and His dwelling shall be glory <font color='#7a8080'>[His rest glorious]</font>!

<p><sup>11</sup> And in that day the Lord shall again lift up His hand a second time to recover (acquire and deliver) the remnant of His people which is left, from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Pathros, from Ethiopia, from Elam <font color='#7a8080'>[in Persia]</font>, from Shinar <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylonia]</font>, from Hamath <font color='#7a8080'>[in Upper Syria]</font>, and from the countries bordering on the <font color='#7a8080'>[Mediterranean]</font> Sea.

<p><sup>12</sup> And He will raise up a signal for the nations and will assemble the outcasts of Israel and will gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

<p><sup>13</sup> The envy <i>and</i> jealousy of Ephraim also shall depart, and they who vex <i>and</i> harass Judah from outside <i>or</i> inside shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex <i>and</i> harass Ephraim.

<p><sup>14</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[with united forces Ephraim and Judah]</font> will swoop down upon the shoulders of the Philistines' <font color='#7a8080'>[land sloping]</font> toward the west; together they will strip the people on the east <font color='#7a8080'>[the Arabs]</font>. They will lay their hands upon Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will obey them.

<p><sup>15</sup> And the Lord will utterly destroy (doom and dry up) the tongue of the Egyptian sea <font color='#7a8080'>[the west fork of the Red Sea]</font>; and with His <font color='#7a8080'>[mighty]</font> scorching wind He will wave His hand over the river <font color='#7a8080'>[Nile]</font> and will smite it into seven channels and will cause men to cross over dry-shod.

<p><sup>16</sup> And there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant left of His people, as there was for Israel when they came up out of the land of Egypt.

<h4>12</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And in that day you will say, I will give thanks to You, O Lord; for though You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You comfort me.

<p><sup>2</sup> Behold, God, my salvation! I will trust and not be afraid, for the Lord God is my strength and song; yes, He has become my salvation.

<p><sup>3</sup> Therefore with joy will you draw water from the wells of salvation.

<p><sup>4</sup> And in that day you will say, Give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name <i>and</i> by means of His name <font color='#7a8080'>[in solemn entreaty]</font>; declare <i>and</i> make known His deeds among the peoples of the earth, proclaim that His name is exalted!

<p><sup>5</sup> Sing praises to the Lord, for He has done excellent things <font color='#7a8080'>[gloriously]</font>; let this be made known to all the earth.

<p><sup>6</sup> Cry aloud and shout joyfully, you women <i>and</i> inhabitants of Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.

<h4>13</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Babylon which Isaiah son of Amoz saw <font color='#7a8080'>[with prophetic insight]</font>:

<p><sup>2</sup> Raise up a signal banner upon the high <i>and</i> bare mountain, summon them <font color='#7a8080'>[the Medes and Persians]</font> with loud voice and beckoning hand that they may enter the gates of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylonian]</font> nobles.

<p><sup>3</sup> I Myself <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font> have commanded My designated ones and have summoned My mighty men to execute My anger, even My proudly exulting ones <font color='#7a8080'>[the Medes and Persians]</font>—those who are made to triumph for My honor.

<p><sup>4</sup> Hark, the uproar of a multitude in the mountains, like that of a great people! The noise of the tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathering together! The Lord of hosts is mustering the host for the battle.

<p><sup>5</sup> They come from a distant country, from the uttermost part of the heavens <font color='#7a8080'>[the far east]</font>—even the Lord and the weapons of His indignation—to seize <i>and</i> destroy the whole land.

<p><sup>6</sup> Wail, for the day of the Lord is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty <i>and</i> Sufficient One <font color='#7a8080'>[Shaddai]</font> will it come!

<p><sup>7</sup> Therefore will all hands be feeble, and every man's heart will melt.

<p><sup>8</sup> And they <font color='#7a8080'>[of Babylon]</font> shall be dismayed and terrified, pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman in childbirth. They will gaze stupefied <i>and</i> aghast at one another, their faces will be aflame <font color='#7a8080'>[from the effects of the unprecedented warfare]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> Behold, the day of the Lord is coming!—fierce, with wrath and raging anger—to make the land <i>and</i> the <font color='#7a8080'>[whole]</font> earth a desolation and to destroy out of it its sinners.

<p><sup>10</sup> For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be darkened at its rising and the moon will not shed its light.

<p><sup>11</sup> And I, the Lord, will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their guilt <i>and</i> iniquity; I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible <i>and</i> the boasting of the violent <i>and</i> ruthless.

<p><sup>12</sup> I will make a man more rare than fine gold, and mankind scarcer than the pure gold of Ophir.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth shall be shaken out of its place at the wrath of the Lord of hosts in the day of His fierce anger.

<p><sup>14</sup> And like the chased roe <i>or</i> gazelle, and like sheep that no man gathers, each <font color='#7a8080'>[foreign resident]</font> will turn to his own people, and each will flee to his own land.

<p><sup>15</sup> Everyone who is found will be thrust through, and everyone who is connected with the slain <i>and</i> is caught will fall by the sword.

<p><sup>16</sup> Their infants also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished.

<p><sup>17</sup> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold <font color='#7a8080'>[and thus cannot be bribed]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> Their bows will cut down the young men <font color='#7a8080'>[of Babylon]</font>; and they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb, their eyes will not spare children.

<p><sup>19</sup> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.

<p><sup>20</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> shall never be inhabited or dwelt in from generation to generation; neither shall the Arab pitch his tent there, nor shall the shepherds make their sheepfolds there.

<p><sup>21</sup> But wild beasts of the desert will lie down there, and the people's houses will be full of dolefully howling creatures; and ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats <font color='#7a8080'>[like demons]</font> will dance there.

<p><sup>22</sup> And wolves <i>and</i> howling creatures will cry <i>and</i> answer in the deserted castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. And <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon's]</font> time has nearly come, and her days will not be prolonged.

<h4>14</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[the captive Jews in Babylon]</font> and will again choose Israel and set them in their own land; and foreigners <font color='#7a8080'>[who are proselytes]</font> will join them and will cleave to the house of Jacob (Israel).

<p><sup>2</sup> And the peoples <font color='#7a8080'>[of Babylonia]</font> shall take them and bring them to their own country <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judea]</font> <i>and</i> help restore them. And the house of Israel will possess <font color='#7a8080'>[the foreigners who prefer to stay with]</font> them in the land of the Lord as male and female servants; and they will take captive <font color='#7a8080'>[not by physical but by moral might]</font> those whose captives they have been, and they will rule over their <font color='#7a8080'>[former]</font> oppressors.

<p><sup>3</sup> When the Lord has given you rest from your sorrow <i>and</i> pain and from your trouble <i>and</i> unrest and from the hard service with which you were made to serve,

<p><sup>4</sup> You shall take up this <font color='#7a8080'>[taunting]</font> parable against the king of Babylon and say, How the oppressor has stilled <font color='#7a8080'>[the restless insolence]</font>! The golden <i>and</i> exacting city has ceased!

<p><sup>5</sup> The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the <font color='#7a8080'>[tyrant]</font> rulers,

<p><sup>6</sup> Who smote the peoples in anger with incessant blows <i>and</i> trod down the nations in wrath with unrelenting persecution—<font color='#7a8080'>[until]</font> he who smote is persecuted and no one hinders any more.

<p><sup>7</sup> The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they break forth into singing.

<p><sup>8</sup> Yes, the fir trees <i>and</i> cypresses rejoice at you <font color='#7a8080'>[O kings of Babylon]</font>, even the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you have been laid low, no woodcutter comes up against us.

<p><sup>9</sup> Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead) below is stirred up to meet you at your coming <font color='#7a8080'>[O tyrant Babylonian rulers]</font>; it stirs up the shades of the dead to greet you—even all the chief ones of the earth; it raises from their thrones <font color='#7a8080'>[in astonishment at your humbled condition]</font> all the kings of the nations.

<p><sup>10</sup> All of them will <font color='#7a8080'>[tauntingly]</font> say to you, Have you also become weak as we are? Have you become like us?

<p><sup>11</sup> Your pomp <i>and</i> magnificence are brought down to Sheol (the underworld), along with the sound of your harps; the maggots <font color='#7a8080'>[which prey upon dead bodies]</font> are spread out under you and worms cover you <font color='#7a8080'>[O Babylonian rulers]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> How have you fallen from heaven, O light-bringer <i>and</i> daystar, son of the morning! How you have been cut down to the ground, you who weakened <i>and</i> laid low the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[O blasphemous, satanic king of Babylon!]</font>

<p><sup>13</sup> And you said in your heart, I will ascend to heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit upon the mount of assembly in the uttermost north.

<p><sup>14</sup> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.

<p><sup>15</sup> Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol (Hades), to the innermost recesses of the pit (the region of the dead).

<p><sup>16</sup> Those who see you will gaze at you <i>and</i> consider you, saying, Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms?—

<p><sup>17</sup> Who made the world like a wilderness and overthrew its cities, who would not permit his prisoners to return home?

<p><sup>18</sup> All the kings of the nations, all of them lie sleeping in glorious array, each one in his own sepulcher.

<p><sup>19</sup> But you are cast away from your tomb like a loathed growth <i>or</i> premature birth <i>or</i> an abominable branch <font color='#7a8080'>[of the family]</font> <i>and</i> like the raiment of the slain; and you are clothed with the slain, those thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit <font color='#7a8080'>[into which carcasses are thrown]</font>, like a dead body trodden underfoot.

<p><sup>20</sup> You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land and have slain your people. May the descendants of evildoers nevermore be named!

<p><sup>21</sup> Prepare a slaughtering place for his sons because of the guilt <i>and</i> iniquity of their fathers, so that they may not rise, possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.

<p><sup>22</sup> And I will rise up against them, says the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son's son, says the Lord.

<p><sup>23</sup> I will also make it a possession of the hedgehog <i>and</i> porcupine, and of marshes <i>and</i> pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>24</sup> The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought <i>and</i> planned, so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand—

<p><sup>25</sup> That I will break the Assyrian in My land, and upon My mountains I will tread him underfoot. Then shall the <font color='#7a8080'>[Assyrian's]</font> yoke depart from <font color='#7a8080'>[the people of Judah]</font>, and his burden depart from their shoulders.

<p><sup>26</sup> This is the <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord's]</font> purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth <font color='#7a8080'>[regarded as conquered and put under tribute by Assyria]</font>; and this is <font color='#7a8080'>[His omnipotent]</font> hand that is stretched out over all the nations.

<p><sup>27</sup> For the Lord of hosts has purposed, and who can annul it? And His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?

<p><sup>28</sup> In the year that King Ahaz <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> died there came this mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up):

<p><sup>29</sup> Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> that smote you is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth an adder <font color='#7a8080'>[King Hezekiah of Judah]</font>, and its <font color='#7a8080'>[the serpent's]</font> offspring will be a fiery, flying serpent.

<p><sup>30</sup> And the firstborn of the poor <i>and</i> the poorest of the poor <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> shall feed on My meadows, and the needy will lie down in safety; but I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant shall be slain.

<p><sup>31</sup> Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! Melt away, O Philistia, all of you! For there is coming a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks <i>and</i> none stands aloof <font color='#7a8080'>[in Hezekiah's battalions]</font>.

<p><sup>32</sup> What then shall one answer the messengers of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Philistine]</font> nation? That the Lord has founded Zion, and in her shall the poor <i>and</i> afflicted of His people trust <i>and</i> find refuge.

<h4>15</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Moab: Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence! Because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence!

<p><sup>2</sup> They are gone up to Bayith and to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, and every beard is cut off <font color='#7a8080'>[as a sign of deep sorrow and humiliation]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their broad places everyone wails, weeping abundantly.

<p><sup>4</sup> And Heshbon and Elealeh <font color='#7a8080'>[cities in possession of Moab]</font> cry out; their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed soldiers of Moab cry out; <font color='#7a8080'>[Moab's]</font> life is grievous <i>and</i> trembles within him.

<p><sup>5</sup> My heart cries out for Moab; his nobles <i>and</i> other fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah <font color='#7a8080'>[like a heifer three years old]</font>. For with weeping they go up the ascent of Luhith; for on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction.

<p><sup>6</sup> For the waters of Nimrim are desolations, for the grass is withered away and the new growth fails; there is no green thing.

<p><sup>7</sup> Therefore the abundance <font color='#7a8080'>[of possessions]</font> they have acquired and stored away they <font color='#7a8080'>[now]</font> carry over the willow brook <i>and</i> to the valley of the Arabians.

<p><sup>8</sup> For the cry <font color='#7a8080'>[of distress]</font> has gone round the borders of Moab; the wailing has reached to Eglaim, and the prolonged <i>and</i> mournful cry to Beer-elim.

<p><sup>9</sup> For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; yet I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> will bring even more on Dimon—a lion upon those of Moab who escape and upon the remnant of the land.

<h4>16</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> You <font color='#7a8080'>[Moabites, now fugitives in Edom, which is ruled by the king of Judah]</font> send lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela <i>or</i> Petra through the desert <i>and</i> wilderness to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> For like wandering birds, like a brood cast out <i>and</i> a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the <font color='#7a8080'>[river]</font> Arnon.

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Say to the ruler]</font> Give counsel, execute justice <font color='#7a8080'>[for Moab, O king of Judah]</font>; make your shade <font color='#7a8080'>[over us]</font> like night in the midst of noonday; hide the outcasts, betray not the fugitive to his pursuer.

<p><sup>4</sup> Let our outcasts of Moab dwell among you; be a sheltered hiding place to them from the destroyer. When the extortion <i>and</i> the extortioner have been brought to nought, and destruction has ceased, and the oppressors <i>and</i> they who trample men are consumed <i>and</i> have vanished out of the land,

<p><sup>5</sup> Then in mercy <i>and</i> loving-kindness shall a throne be established, and  One shall sit upon it in truth <i>and</i> faithfulness in the tent of David, judging and seeking justice and being swift to do righteousness.

<p><sup>6</sup> We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud—even of his arrogance, his conceit, his wrath, his untruthful boasting.

<p><sup>7</sup> Moab therefore shall wail for Moab; everyone shall wail. For the ruins, flagons of wine, <i>and</i> the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth you shall sigh and mourn, utterly stricken <i>and</i> discouraged.

<p><sup>8</sup> For the fields of Heshbon languish <i>and</i> wither, and the vines of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down <font color='#7a8080'>[Moab's]</font> choice vine branches, which reached even to Jazer, wandering into the wilderness; its shoots stretched out abroad, they passed over <font color='#7a8080'>[the shores of]</font> the <font color='#7a8080'>[Dead]</font> Sea.

<p><sup>9</sup> Therefore I <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah]</font> will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vines of Sibmah. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for upon your summer fruits and your harvest the shout <font color='#7a8080'>[of alarm and the cry of the enemy]</font> has fallen.

<p><sup>10</sup> And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing, nor is there joyful sound; the treaders tread out no wine in the presses, for the shout of joy has been made to cease.

<p><sup>11</sup> Wherefore my heart sounds like a harp <font color='#7a8080'>[in mournful compassion]</font> for Moab, and my inner being <font color='#7a8080'>[goes out]</font> for Kir-hareseth <font color='#7a8080'>[for those brick-walled citadels of his]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> It shall be that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself <font color='#7a8080'>[worshiping]</font> on the high place <font color='#7a8080'>[of idolatry]</font>, he will come to his sanctuary <font color='#7a8080'>[of Chemosh, god of Moab]</font>, but he will not prevail. <font color='#7a8080'>[Then will he be ashamed of his god.]</font>

<p><sup>13</sup> This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning Moab since that time <font color='#7a8080'>[when Moab's pride and resistance to God were first known]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> But now the Lord has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling <font color='#7a8080'>[who will not serve longer than the allotted time]</font>, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, in spite of all his mighty multitudes of people; and the remnant that survives will be very small, feeble, <i>and</i> of no account.

<h4>17</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Damascus <font color='#7a8080'>[capital of Syria, and Israel's bulwark against Assyria]</font>. Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins.

<p><sup>2</sup> The cities of Aroer <font color='#7a8080'>[east of the Jordan]</font> are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

<p><sup>3</sup> His bulwark <font color='#7a8080'>[Syria]</font> <i>and</i> the fortress shall disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Syria will be like the <font color='#7a8080'>[departed]</font> glory of the children of Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[her ally]</font>, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>4</sup> And in that day the former glory of Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel—his might, his population, his prosperity]</font> shall be enfeebled, and the fat of his flesh shall become lean.

<p><sup>5</sup> And it shall be as when the reaper gathers the standing grain and his arm harvests the ears; yes, it shall be as when one gathers the ears of grain in the fertile Valley of Rephaim.

<p><sup>6</sup> Yet gleanings <font color='#7a8080'>[of grapes]</font> shall be left in it <font color='#7a8080'>[the land of Israel]</font>, as after the beating of an olive tree <font color='#7a8080'>[with a stick]</font>, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of the fruitful tree, says the Lord, the God of Israel.

<p><sup>7</sup> In that day will men look to their Maker, and their eyes shall regard the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>8</sup> And they will not look to the <font color='#7a8080'>[idolatrous]</font> altars, the work of their hands, neither will they have respect for what their fingers have made—either the Asherim <font color='#7a8080'>[symbols of the goddess Asherah]</font> or the sun-images.

<p><sup>9</sup> In that day will their <font color='#7a8080'>[Syria's and Israel's]</font> strong cities be like the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountaintop, as they <font color='#7a8080'>[the Amorites and the Hivites]</font> forsook their <font color='#7a8080'>[cities]</font> because of the children of Israel; and there will be desolation.

<p><sup>10</sup> Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation <font color='#7a8080'>[O Judah]</font> and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, your Stronghold—therefore, you have planted pleasant nursery grounds <i>and</i> plantings <font color='#7a8080'>[to Adonis, pots of quickly withered flowers used to set by their doors or in the courts of temples]</font>, and have set <font color='#7a8080'>[the grounds]</font> with vine slips of a strange <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font>,

<p><sup>11</sup> And in the day of your planting you hedge it in, and in the morning you make your seed to blossom, yet <font color='#7a8080'>[promising as it is]</font> the harvest shall be a heap of ruins <i>and</i> flee away in the day of expected possession and of desperate sorrow <i>and</i> sickening, incurable pain.

<p><sup>12</sup> Hark, the uproar of a multitude of peoples! They roar <i>and</i> thunder like the noise of the seas! Ah, the roar of nations! They roar like the roaring of rushing <i>and</i> mighty waters!

<p><sup>13</sup> The nations will rush <i>and</i> roar like the rushing <i>and</i> roaring of many waters—but <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> will rebuke them, and they will flee far off and will be chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind, and like rolling thistledown <i>or</i> whirling dust of the stubble before the storm.

<p><sup>14</sup> At evening time, behold, terror! And before the morning, they <font color='#7a8080'>[the terrorizing Assyrians]</font> are not. This is the portion of those who strip us <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jews]</font> of what belongs to us, and the lot of those who rob us. <font color='#7a8080'>[Fulfilled in Isa. 37:36.]</font>

<h4>18</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to the land whirring with wings which is beyond the rivers of Cush <i>or</i> Ethiopia,

<p><sup>2</sup> That sends ambassadors by the Nile, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters! Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and polished, to a people terrible from their beginning <font color='#7a8080'>[feared and dreaded near and far]</font>, a nation strong and victorious, whose land the rivers divide!

<p><sup>3</sup> All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains—look! When a trumpet is blown—hear!

<p><sup>4</sup> For thus the Lord has said to me: I will be still and I will look on from My dwelling place, like clear <i>and</i> glowing heat in sunshine, like a fine cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.

<p><sup>5</sup> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over and the flower becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and the spreading branches He will remove and cut away.

<p><sup>6</sup> They <font color='#7a8080'>[the dead bodies of the slain warriors]</font> shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds will summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth will winter upon them.

<p><sup>7</sup> At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people tall and polished, from a people terrible from their beginning <i>and</i> feared <i>and</i> dreaded near and far, a nation strong and victorious, whose land the rivers <i>or</i> great channels divide—to the place <font color='#7a8080'>[of worship]</font> of the Name of the Lord of hosts, to Mount Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[in Jerusalem]</font>.

<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Egypt: Behold, the Lord is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, and the hearts of the Egyptians will melt within them.

<p><sup>2</sup> And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, every one against his brother and every one against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

<p><sup>3</sup> And the spirit of the Egyptians within them will become exhausted and emptied out <i>and</i> will fail, and I will destroy their counsel <i>and</i> confound their plans; and they will seek counsel from the idols and the sorcerers, and from those having familiar spirits (the mediums) and the wizards.

<p><sup>4</sup> And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard <i>and</i> cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them, says the Lord, the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>5</sup> And the waters shall fail from the Nile, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.

<p><sup>6</sup> And the rivers shall become foul, the streams <i>and</i> canals of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up, the reeds and the rushes shall wither <i>and</i> rot away.

<p><sup>7</sup> The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile shall become dry, be blown away, and be no more.

<p><sup>8</sup> The fishermen will lament, and all who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn; and they who spread nets upon the waters will languish.

<p><sup>9</sup> Moreover, they who work with combed flax and they who weave white <font color='#7a8080'>[cotton]</font> cloth will be confounded <i>and</i> in despair.

<p><sup>10</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Those who are]</font> the pillars <i>and</i> foundations of Egypt will be crushed, and all those who work for hire <i>or</i> who build dams will be grieved.

<p><sup>11</sup> The princes of Zoan <font color='#7a8080'>[ancient capital of the Pharaohs]</font> are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become witless (stupid). How can you say to Pharaoh, I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings?

<p><sup>12</sup> Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now <font color='#7a8080'>[if they are so wise]</font>, and let them make known what the Lord of hosts has purposed against Egypt <font color='#7a8080'>[if they can]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> The princes of Zoan have become fools, and the princes of Memphis are confused <i>and</i> deceived; those who are the cornerstones of her tribes have led Egypt astray.

<p><sup>14</sup> The Lord has mingled a spirit of perverseness, error, <i>and</i> confusion within her; <font color='#7a8080'>[her leaders]</font> have caused Egypt to stagger in all her doings, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.

<p><sup>15</sup> Neither can any work <font color='#7a8080'>[done singly or by concerted action]</font> accomplish anything for Egypt, whether by head or tail, palm branch or rush <font color='#7a8080'>[high or low]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> In that day will the Egyptians be like women <font color='#7a8080'>[timid and helpless]</font>; and they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts which He shakes over them.

<p><sup>17</sup> And the land of Judah <font color='#7a8080'>[allied to Assyria]</font> shall become a terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom mention of it is made will be afraid <i>and</i> everyone who mentions it—to him will they turn in fear, because of the purpose of the Lord of hosts which He purposes against Egypt.

<p><sup>18</sup> In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of <font color='#7a8080'>[the Hebrews of]</font> Canaan and swear allegiance to the Lord of hosts. One of them will be called the City of the Sun <i>or</i> Destruction.

<p><sup>19</sup> In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord at its border.

<p><sup>20</sup> And it will be a sign and a witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the Lord because of oppressors, and He will send them a savior, even a mighty one, and he will deliver them.

<p><sup>21</sup> And the Lord will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know (have knowledge of, be acquainted with, give heed to, and cherish) the Lord in that day and will worship with sacrifices of animal <i>and</i> vegetable offerings; they will vow a vow to the Lord and perform it.

<p><sup>22</sup> And the Lord shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing it; and they will return to the Lord, and He will listen to their entreaties and heal them.

<p><sup>23</sup> In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> with the Assyrians.

<p><sup>24</sup> In that day Israel shall be the third, with Egypt and with Assyria <font color='#7a8080'>[in a Messianic league]</font>, a blessing in the midst of the earth,

<p><sup>25</sup> Whom the Lord of hosts has blessed, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people and Assyria the work of My hands and Israel My heritage.

<h4>20</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In the year that the Tartan <font color='#7a8080'>[Assyrian commander in chief]</font> came to Ashdod in Philistia, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, he fought against Ashdod and took it.

<p><sup>2</sup> At that time the Lord spoke by Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, Go, loose the sackcloth from off your loins and take your shoes off your feet. And he had done so, walking around stripped <font color='#7a8080'>[to his loincloth]</font> and barefoot.

<p><sup>3</sup> And the Lord said, As My servant Isaiah has walked <font color='#7a8080'>[comparatively]</font> naked and barefoot for three years, as a sign and forewarning concerning Egypt and concerning Cush (Ethiopia),

<p><sup>4</sup> So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Ethiopian exiles, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with buttocks uncovered—to the shame of Egypt.

<p><sup>5</sup> And they shall be dismayed and confounded because of Ethiopia their hope <i>and</i> expectation and Egypt their glory <i>and</i> boast.

<p><sup>6</sup> And the inhabitants of this coastland <font color='#7a8080'>[the Israelites and their neighbors]</font> will say in that day, See! This is what comes to those in whom we trusted <i>and</i> hoped, to whom we fled for help to deliver us from the king of Assyria! But we, how shall we escape <font color='#7a8080'>[captivity and exile]</font>?

<h4>21</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning the Desert of the Sea <font color='#7a8080'>[which was Babylon after great dams were raised to control the waters of the Euphrates River which overflowed it like a sea—and would do so again]</font>: As whirlwinds in the South (the Negeb) sweep through, so it <font color='#7a8080'>[the judgment of God by hostile armies]</font> comes from the desert, from a terrible land.

<p><sup>2</sup> A hard <i>and</i> grievous vision is declared to me: the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! All the sighing <font color='#7a8080'>[caused by Babylon's ruthless oppressions]</font> I will cause to cease <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Therefore are my <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah's]</font> loins filled with anguish, pangs have seized me like the pangs of a woman in childbirth; I am bent <i>and</i> pained so that I cannot hear, I am dismayed so that I cannot see.

<p><sup>4</sup> My mind reels <i>and</i> wanders, horror terrifies me. <font color='#7a8080'>[In my mind's eye I am at the feast of Belshazzar. I see the defilement of the golden vessels taken from God's temple, I watch the handwriting appear on the wall—I know that Babylon's great king is to be slain.]</font> The twilight I looked forward to with pleasure has been turned into fear <i>and</i> trembling for me.

<p><sup>5</sup> They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, <font color='#7a8080'>[and having]</font> set the watchers <font color='#7a8080'>[the revelers take no other precaution]</font>, they eat, they drink. Arise, you princes, and oil your shields <font color='#7a8080'>[for your deadly foe is at the gates]</font>!

<p><sup>6</sup> For thus has the Lord said to me: Go, set <font color='#7a8080'>[yourself as]</font> a watchman, let him declare what he sees.

<p><sup>7</sup> And when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, and a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently, very diligently.

<p><sup>8</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[the watchman]</font> cried like a lion, O Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my station every night.

<p><sup>9</sup> And see! Here comes a troop of men <i>and</i> chariots, horsemen in pairs! And he <font color='#7a8080'>[the watchman]</font> tells <font color='#7a8080'>[what it foretells]</font>: Babylon has fallen, has fallen! And all the graven images of her gods lie shattered on the ground <font color='#7a8080'>[in my vision]</font>!

<p><sup>10</sup> O you my threshed and winnowed ones <font color='#7a8080'>[my own people the Jews, who must be trodden down by Babylon]</font>, that which I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have <font color='#7a8080'>[joyfully]</font> announced to you <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon is to fall]</font>!

<p><sup>11</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Dumah (Edom): One calls to me from Seir (Edom), Watchman, what of the night? <font color='#7a8080'>[How far is it spent? How long till morning?]</font> Guardian, what of the night?

<p><sup>12</sup> The watchman said, The morning comes, but also the night. <font color='#7a8080'>[Another time, if Edom earnestly wishes to know]</font> if you will inquire <font color='#7a8080'>[of me]</font>, inquire; return, come again.

<p><sup>13</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Arabia: In the forests <i>and</i> thickets of Arabia you shall lodge, O you caravans of Dedanites <font color='#7a8080'>[from northern Arabia]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> To the thirsty <font color='#7a8080'>[Dedanites]</font> bring water, O inhabitants of the land of Tema <font color='#7a8080'>[in Arabia]</font>; meet the fugitive with bread <font color='#7a8080'>[suitable]</font> for him.

<p><sup>15</sup> For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war <font color='#7a8080'>[the press of battle]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> For the Lord has said this to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling <font color='#7a8080'>[who will work no longer than was agreed]</font>, all the glory of Kedar <font color='#7a8080'>[an Arabian tribe]</font> will fail.

<p><sup>17</sup> And the remainder of the number of archers <i>and</i> their bows, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be diminished <i>and</i> few; for the Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken it.

<h4>22</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning the Valley of Vision: What do you mean <font color='#7a8080'>[I wonder]</font> that you have all gone up to the housetops,

<p><sup>2</sup> You who are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous <i>and</i> exultant city? <font color='#7a8080'>[O Jerusalem]</font> your slain warriors have not met <font color='#7a8080'>[a glorious]</font> death with the sword or in battle.

<p><sup>3</sup> All your <font color='#7a8080'>[military]</font> leaders have fled together; without the bow <font color='#7a8080'>[which they had thrown away]</font> they have been taken captive <i>and</i> bound by the archers. All of you who were found were bound together <font color='#7a8080'>[as captives]</font>, though they had fled far away.

<p><sup>4</sup> Therefore I <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah]</font> said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly. Do not hasten <i>and</i> try to comfort me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<p><sup>5</sup> For it is a day of discomfiture <i>and</i> of tumult, of treading down, of confusion <i>and</i> perplexity from the Lord God of hosts in the Valley of Vision, a day of breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountains.

<p><sup>6</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[in my vision I saw]</font> Elam take up the quiver, with troops in chariots, infantry, <i>and</i> horsemen; and Kir <font color='#7a8080'>[with Elam subject to Assyria]</font> uncovered the shield.

<p><sup>7</sup> And it came to pass that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen took their station <font color='#7a8080'>[and set themselves in offensive array at the gate of Jerusalem]</font>. <font color='#7a8080'>[Fulfilled in II Chron. 32; Isa. 36.]</font>

<p><sup>8</sup> Then <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> removed the protective covering of Judah; and you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest <font color='#7a8080'>[the king's armory]</font> in that day.

<p><sup>9</sup> You saw that the breaches <font color='#7a8080'>[in the walls]</font> of the City of David <font color='#7a8080'>[the citadel of Zion]</font> were many; <font color='#7a8080'>[since the water supply was still defective]</font> you collected <font color='#7a8080'>[within the city's walls]</font> the waters of the Lower Pool.

<p><sup>10</sup> And you numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses <font color='#7a8080'>[to get materials]</font> to fortify the <font color='#7a8080'>[city]</font> wall.

<p><sup>11</sup> You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the Maker of it, nor did you recognize Him Who planned it long ago.

<p><sup>12</sup> And in that day the Lord God of hosts called you to weeping and mourning, to the shaving off of all your hair <font color='#7a8080'>[in humiliation]</font> and to the girding with sackcloth.

<p><sup>13</sup> But instead, see the pleasure and mirth, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, <font color='#7a8080'>[with the idea]</font> Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!

<p><sup>14</sup> And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears <font color='#7a8080'>[as He said]</font>, Surely this unatoned sin shall not be purged from you until <font color='#7a8080'>[you are punished—and the punishment will be]</font> death, says the Lord God of hosts.

<p><sup>15</sup> Come, go to this <font color='#7a8080'>[contemptible]</font> steward <i>and</i> treasurer, to Shebna, who is over the house <font color='#7a8080'>[but who is presumptuous enough to be building himself a tomb among those of the mighty, a tomb worthy of a king]</font>, and say to him,

<p><sup>16</sup> What business have you here? And whom have you entombed here, that you have the right to hew out for yourself a tomb here? He hews out a sepulcher for himself on the height! He carves out a dwelling for himself in the rock!

<p><sup>17</sup> Behold, the Lord will hurl you away violently, O you strong man; yes, He will take tight hold of you <i>and</i> He will surely cover you <font color='#7a8080'>[with shame]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> He will surely roll you up in a bundle <font color='#7a8080'>[Shebna]</font> and toss you like a ball into a large country; there you will die and there will be your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master's house!

<p><sup>19</sup> And I will thrust you from your office, and from your station will you be pulled down.

<p><sup>20</sup> And in that day I will call My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.

<p><sup>21</sup> And I will clothe him with your robe and will bind your girdle on him and will commit your authority to his hand; he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

<p><sup>22</sup> And the key of the house of David I will lay upon his shoulder; he shall open and no one shall shut, he shall shut and no one shall open.

<p><sup>23</sup> And I will fasten him like a peg <i>or</i> nail in a firm place; and he will become a throne of honor <i>and</i> glory to his father's house.

<p><sup>24</sup> And they will hang on him the honor <i>and</i> the whole weight of <font color='#7a8080'>[responsibility for]</font> his father's house: the offspring and issue <font color='#7a8080'>[of the family, high and low]</font>, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flasks <i>and</i> big bulging bottles.

<p><sup>25</sup> In that day, says the Lord of hosts, the nail <i>or</i> peg that was fastened into the sure place shall give way <i>and</i> be moved and be hewn down and fall, and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for the Lord has spoken it.

<h4>23</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Tyre: Wail, you ships of <font color='#7a8080'>[Tyre returning from trading with]</font> Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house, no harbor; from the land of Kittim (Cyprus) they learn of it.

<p><sup>2</sup> Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you merchants of Sidon, <i>your messengers</i> passing over the sea have replenished you <font color='#7a8080'>[with wealth and industry]</font>,

<p><sup>3</sup> And were on great waters. The seed <i>or</i> grain of the Shihor, the harvest <font color='#7a8080'>[due to the overflow]</font> of the Nile River, was <font color='#7a8080'>[Tyre's]</font> revenue, and she became the merchandise of the nations.

<p><sup>4</sup> Be ashamed, O Sidon <font color='#7a8080'>[mother-city of Tyre, now a widow bereaved of her children]</font>, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have neither travailed nor brought forth children; I have neither nourished <i>and</i> reared young men nor brought up virgins.

<p><sup>5</sup> When the report comes to Egypt, they will be sorely pained over the report about Tyre.

<p><sup>6</sup> Pass over to Tarshish <font color='#7a8080'>[to seek safety as exiles]</font>! Wail, you inhabitants of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Tyre]</font> coast!

<p><sup>7</sup> Is this your jubilant city, whose origin dates back into antiquity, whose own feet are accustomed to carry her far off to settle <font color='#7a8080'>[daughter cities]</font>?

<p><sup>8</sup> Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?

<p><sup>9</sup> The Lord of hosts has purposed it <font color='#7a8080'>[in accordance with a fixed principle of His government]</font>, to defile the pride of all glory and to bring into dishonor <i>and</i> contempt all the honored of the earth.

<p><sup>10</sup> Overflow your land like <font color='#7a8080'>[the overflow of]</font> the Nile River, O Daughter of Tarshish; there is no girdle of restraint <font color='#7a8080'>[on you]</font> any more <font color='#7a8080'>[to make you pay tribute or customs or duties to Tyre]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> He stretched out His hand over the sea, He shook the kingdoms; the Lord has given a command concerning Canaan to destroy her strongholds <i>and</i> fortresses <font color='#7a8080'>[Tyre, Sidon, etc.]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> And He said, You shall no more exult, you oppressed <i>and</i> crushed one, O Virgin Daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim (Cyprus); but even there you will have no rest.

<p><sup>13</sup> Look at the land of the Chaldeans! That people and not the Assyrians designed <i>and</i> assigned <font color='#7a8080'>[Tyre]</font> for the wild beasts <i>and</i> those who <font color='#7a8080'>[previously]</font> dwelt in the wilderness. They set up their siege works, they overthrew its palaces, they made it a ruin!

<p><sup>14</sup> Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold <font color='#7a8080'>[of Tyre]</font> is laid waste <font color='#7a8080'>[your strength has been destroyed]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> And in that day Tyre will be in obscurity <i>and</i> forgotten for seventy years, according to the days of one dynasty. After the end of seventy years will Tyre sing as a harlot <font color='#7a8080'>[who has been forgotten but again attracts her lovers]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> Take a harp, go about the city, forgotten harlot; play skillfully <i>and</i> make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.

<p><sup>17</sup> And after the end of seventy years the Lord will remember Tyre; and she will return to her hire and will play the harlot <font color='#7a8080'>[resume her commerce]</font> with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.

<p><sup>18</sup> But her gain and her hire <font color='#7a8080'>[the profits of Tyre's new prosperity]</font> will be dedicated to the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[eventually]</font>; it will not be treasured or stored up, for her gain will be used for those who dwell in the presence of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[the ministers]</font>, that they may eat sufficiently and have durable <i>and</i> stately clothing <font color='#7a8080'>[suitable for those who minister at God's altar]</font>.

<h4>24</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Behold, the Lord will make the land <i>and</i> the earth empty and make it waste and turn it upside down (twist the face of it) and scatter abroad its inhabitants.

<p><sup>2</sup> And it shall be—as <font color='#7a8080'>[what happens]</font> with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.

<p><sup>3</sup> The land <i>and</i> the earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly pillaged; for the Lord has said this.

<p><sup>4</sup> The land <i>and</i> the earth mourn and wither, the world languishes and withers, the high ones of the people <font color='#7a8080'>[and the heavens with the earth]</font> languish.

<p><sup>5</sup> The land <i>and</i> the earth also are defiled by their inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, disregarded the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore a curse devours the land <i>and</i> the earth, and they who dwell in it suffer the punishment of their guilt. Therefore the inhabitants of the land <i>and</i> the earth are scorched <i>and</i> parched <font color='#7a8080'>[under the curse of God's wrath]</font>, and few people are left.

<p><sup>7</sup> The new wine mourns, the vine languishes; all the merrymakers sigh.

<p><sup>8</sup> The mirth of the timbrels is stilled, the noise of those who rejoice ends, the joy of the lyre is stopped.

<p><sup>9</sup> No more will they drink wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.

<p><sup>10</sup> The wasted city of emptiness <i>and</i> confusion is broken down; every house is shut up so that no one may enter.

<p><sup>11</sup> There is crying in the streets for wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is banished <i>and</i> gone into captivity.

<p><sup>12</sup> In the city is left desolation, and its gate is battered <i>and</i> destroyed.

<p><sup>13</sup> For so shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking <i>and</i> beating of an olive tree, or as the gleaning when the vintage is done <font color='#7a8080'>[and only a small amount of the fruit remains]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But]</font> these <font color='#7a8080'>[who have escaped and remain]</font> lift up their voices, they shout; for the majesty of the Lord they cry aloud from the <font color='#7a8080'>[Mediterranean]</font> Sea.

<p><sup>15</sup> Wherefore glorify the Lord in the east <font color='#7a8080'>[whether in the region of daybreak's lights and fires, or in the west]</font>; <font color='#7a8080'>[glorify]</font> the name of the Lord, the God of Israel in the isles <i>and</i> coasts of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Mediterranean]</font> Sea.

<p><sup>16</sup> From the uttermost parts of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the Righteous One <font color='#7a8080'>[and to the people of Israel]</font>! But I say, Emaciated I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! The treacherous dealers deal treacherously! Yes, the treacherous dealers deal very treacherously.

<p><sup>17</sup> Terror and pit <font color='#7a8080'>[of destruction]</font> and snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!

<p><sup>18</sup> And he who flees at the noise of the terror will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the pit will be caught in the snare. For the windows of the heavens are opened <font color='#7a8080'>[as in the deluge]</font>, and the foundations of the earth tremble <i>and</i> shake.

<p><sup>19</sup> The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is shaken violently.

<p><sup>20</sup> The earth shall stagger like a drunken man and shall sway to and fro like a hammock; its transgression shall lie heavily upon it, and it shall fall and not rise again.

<p><sup>21</sup> And in that day the Lord will visit <i>and</i> punish the host of the high ones on high <font color='#7a8080'>[the host of heaven in heaven, celestial beings]</font> and the kings of the earth on the earth.

<p><sup>22</sup> And they will be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in a pit <i>or</i> dungeon; they will be shut up in prison, and after many days they will be visited, inspected, <i>and</i> punished <i>or</i> pardoned.

<p><sup>23</sup> Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, when <font color='#7a8080'>[they compare their ineffectual fire to the light of]</font> the Lord of hosts, Who will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders will show forth His glory.

<h4>25</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> O Lord, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise Your name, for You have done wonderful things, even purposes planned of old <font color='#7a8080'>[and fulfilled]</font> in faithfulness and truth.

<p><sup>2</sup> For You have made a city a heap, a fortified city a ruin, a palace of aliens without a city <font color='#7a8080'>[is no more a city]</font>; it will never be rebuilt.

<p><sup>3</sup> Therefore <font color='#7a8080'>[many]</font> a strong people will glorify You, <font color='#7a8080'>[many]</font> a city of terrible <i>and</i> ruthless nations will <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fear You.

<p><sup>4</sup> For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat; for the blast of the ruthless ones is like a rainstorm against a wall.

<p><sup>5</sup> As the heat in a dry land <font color='#7a8080'>[is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so]</font> You will bring down the noise of aliens <font color='#7a8080'>[exultant over their enemies]</font>; and as the heat is brought low by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless ones is brought low.

<p><sup>6</sup> And on this Mount <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font> shall the Lord of hosts make for all peoples a feast of rich things <font color='#7a8080'>[symbolic of His coronation festival inaugurating the reign of the Lord on earth, in the wake of a background of gloom, judgment, and terror]</font>, a feast of wines on the lees—of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

<p><sup>7</sup> And He will destroy on this mountain the covering of the face that is cast over the heads of all peoples <font color='#7a8080'>[in mourning]</font>, and the veil <font color='#7a8080'>[of profound wretchedness]</font> that is woven <i>and</i> spread over all nations.

<p><sup>8</sup> He will swallow up death <font color='#7a8080'>[in victory; He will abolish death forever]</font>. And the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces; and the reproach of His people He will take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken it.

<p><sup>9</sup> It shall be said in that day, Behold our God upon Whom we have waited <i>and</i> hoped, that He might save us! This is the Lord, we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.

<p><sup>10</sup> For the hand of the Lord shall rest on this Mount <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font>, and Moab shall be threshed <i>and</i> trodden down in his place as straw is trodden down in the <font color='#7a8080'>[filthy]</font> water of a <font color='#7a8080'>[primitive]</font> cesspit.

<p><sup>11</sup> And though <font color='#7a8080'>[Moab]</font> stretches forth his hands in the midst of <font color='#7a8080'>[the filthy water]</font> as a swimmer stretches out his hands to swim, the Lord will bring down <font color='#7a8080'>[Moab's]</font> pride in spite of the skillfulness of his hands <i>and</i> together with the spoils of his hands.

<p><sup>12</sup> And the high fortifications of your walls <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> will bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

<h4>26</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> sets up salvation as walls and bulwarks.

<p><sup>2</sup> Open the gates, that the <font color='#7a8080'>[uncompromisingly]</font> righteous nation which keeps her faith <i>and</i> her troth <font color='#7a8080'>[with God]</font> may enter in.

<p><sup>3</sup> You will guard him <i>and</i> keep him in perfect <i>and</i> constant peace whose mind <font color='#7a8080'>[both its inclination and its character]</font> is stayed on You, because he commits himself to You, leans on You, <i>and</i> hopes confidently in You.

<p><sup>4</sup> So trust in the Lord (commit yourself to Him, lean on Him, hope confidently in Him) forever; for the Lord God is an everlasting Rock <font color='#7a8080'>[the Rock of Ages]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> For He has brought down the inhabitants of the height, the lofty city; He lays it low, lays it low to the ground; He brings it even to the dust.

<p><sup>6</sup> The foot has trampled it down—even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.

<p><sup>7</sup> The way of the <font color='#7a8080'>[consistently]</font> righteous (those living in moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relationship of their lives) is level <i>and</i> straight; You, O <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord]</font>, Who are upright, direct aright <i>and</i> make level the path of the <font color='#7a8080'>[uncompromisingly]</font> just <i>and</i> righteous.

<p><sup>8</sup> Yes, in the path of Your judgments, O Lord, we wait <font color='#7a8080'>[expectantly]</font> for You; our heartfelt desire is for Your name and for the remembrance of You.

<p><sup>9</sup> My soul yearns for You <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> in the night, yes, my spirit within me seeks You earnestly; for <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> when Your judgments are in the earth will the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God).

<p><sup>10</sup> Though favor is shown to the wicked, yet they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and refuse to see the majesty of the Lord.

<p><sup>11</sup> Though Your hand is lifted high to strike, Lord, they do not see it. Let them see Your zeal for Your people and be ashamed; yes, let the fire reserved for Your enemies consume them.

<p><sup>12</sup> Lord, You will ordain peace (God's favor and blessings, both temporal and spiritual) for us, for You have also wrought in us <i>and</i> for us all our works.

<p><sup>13</sup> O Lord, our God, other masters besides You have ruled over us, but we will acknowledge <i>and</i> mention Your name only.

<p><sup>14</sup> They <font color='#7a8080'>[the former tyrant masters]</font> are dead, they shall not live <i>and</i> reappear; they are powerless ghosts, they shall not rise <i>and</i> come back. Therefore You have visited and made an end of them and caused every memory of them <font color='#7a8080'>[every trace of their supremacy]</font> to perish.

<p><sup>15</sup> You have increased the nation, O Lord; You have increased the nation. You are glorified; You have enlarged all the borders of the land.

<p><sup>16</sup> Lord, when they were in trouble <i>and</i> distress, they sought <i>and</i> visited You; they poured out a prayerful whisper when Your chastening was upon them.

<p><sup>17</sup> As a woman with child drawing near the time of her delivery is in pain <i>and</i> writhes and cries out in her pangs, so we have been before You (at Your presence), O Lord.

<p><sup>18</sup> We have been with child, we have been writhing <i>and</i> in pain; we have, as it were, brought forth <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> wind. We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, and the inhabitants of the world <font color='#7a8080'>[of Israel]</font> have not yet been born.

<p><sup>19</sup> Your dead shall live <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font>; the bodies of our dead <font color='#7a8080'>[saints]</font> shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For Your dew <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font> is a dew of <font color='#7a8080'>[sparkling]</font> light <font color='#7a8080'>[heavenly, supernatural dew]</font>; and the earth shall cast forth the dead <font color='#7a8080'>[to life again; for on the land of the shades of the dead You will let Your dew fall]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> Come, my people, enter your chambers and shut your doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until the <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord's]</font> wrath is past.

<p><sup>21</sup> For behold, the Lord is coming out of His place <font color='#7a8080'>[heaven]</font> to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also will disclose the blood shed upon her and will no longer cover her slain <i>and</i> conceal her guilt.

<h4>27</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In that day <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord will deliver Israel from her enemies and also from the rebel powers of evil and darkness]</font> His sharp <i>and</i> unrelenting, great, and strong sword will visit <i>and</i> punish Leviathan the swiftly fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting <i>and</i> winding serpent; and He will slay the monster that is in the sea.

<p><sup>2</sup> In that day <font color='#7a8080'>[it will be said of the redeemed nation of Israel]</font>, A vineyard beloved <i>and</i> lovely; sing a responsive song to it <i>and</i> about it!

<p><sup>3</sup> I, the Lord, am its Keeper; I water it every moment; lest anyone harm it, I guard <i>and</i> keep it night and day.

<p><sup>4</sup> Wrath is not in Me. Would that the briers <i>and</i> thorns <font color='#7a8080'>[the wicked internal foe]</font> were lined up against Me in battle! I would stride in against them; I would burn them up together.

<p><sup>5</sup> Or else <font color='#7a8080'>[if all Israel would escape being burned up together there is but one alternative]</font>, let them take hold of My strength <i>and</i> make complete surrender to My protection, that they may make peace with Me! Yes, let them make peace with Me!

<p><sup>6</sup> In the days <i>and</i> generations to come Jacob shall take root; Israel shall blossom and send forth shoots and fill the whole world with fruit <font color='#7a8080'>[of the knowledge of the true God]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> Has <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> smitten <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> as He smote those who smote them? Or have <font color='#7a8080'>[the Israelites]</font> been slain as their slayers were slain?

<p><sup>8</sup> By driving them out of Canaan, by exile, You contended with them in a measure <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font>—He removed them with His rough blast as in the day of the east wind.

<p><sup>9</sup> Only on this condition shall the iniquity of Jacob (Israel) be forgiven <i>and</i> purged, and this shall be the full fruit <font color='#7a8080'>[God requires]</font> for taking away his sin: that <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> should make all the stones of the <font color='#7a8080'>[idol]</font> altars like chalk stones crushed to pieces, so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall not remain standing <i>or</i> rise again.

<p><sup>10</sup> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken like the wilderness; there the calf grazes, and there he lies down; he strips its branches <i>and</i> eats its twigs.

<p><sup>11</sup> When its boughs are withered <i>and</i> dry, they are broken off; the women come <i>and</i> set them afire. For they are a people of no understanding <i>or</i> discernment—<i>witless folk</i>; therefore He Who made them will not have compassion on them, and He Who formed them will show them no favor.

<p><sup>12</sup> And it shall be in that day that the Lord will thresh out His grain from the flood of the River <font color='#7a8080'>[Euphrates]</font> to the Brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one <i>and</i> one to another, O children of Israel!

<p><sup>13</sup> And it shall be in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and they will come who were lost <i>and</i> ready to perish in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt, and they will worship the Lord on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

<h4>28</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to <font color='#7a8080'>[Samaria]</font> the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim <font color='#7a8080'>[the ten tribes]</font>, and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome <i>and</i> smitten down with wine!

<p><sup>2</sup> Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty one <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian]</font>; like a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, like a flood of mighty overflowing waters, he will cast it down to the earth with violent hand.

<p><sup>3</sup> With <font color='#7a8080'>[alien]</font> feet <font color='#7a8080'>[Samaria]</font> the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden down.

<p><sup>4</sup> And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the rich valley, will be like the early fig before the fruit harvest, which, when anyone sees it, he snatches and eats it up greedily at once. <font color='#7a8080'>[So in an amazingly short time will the Assyrians devour Samaria, Israel's capital.]</font>

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But]</font> in that <font color='#7a8080'>[future Messianic]</font> day the Lord of hosts shall become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the <font color='#7a8080'>[converted]</font> remnant of His people,

<p><sup>6</sup> And a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment <i>and</i> administers the law, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

<p><sup>7</sup> But even these reel from wine and stagger from strong drink: the priest and the prophet reel from strong drink; they are confused from wine, they stagger <i>and</i> are gone astray through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble when pronouncing judgment.

<p><sup>8</sup> For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, so that there is no place that is clean.

<p><sup>9</sup> To whom will He teach knowledge? <font color='#7a8080'>[Ask the drunkards.]</font> And whom will He make to understand the message? Those who are babies, just weaned from the milk and taken from the breasts? <font color='#7a8080'>[Is that what He thinks we are?]</font>

<p><sup>10</sup> For it is <font color='#7a8080'>[His prophets repeating over and over]</font>: precept upon precept, precept upon precept, rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little.

<p><sup>11</sup> No, but <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord will teach the rebels in a more humiliating way]</font> by men with stammering lips and another tongue will He speak to this people <font color='#7a8080'>[says Isaiah, and teach them His lessons]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> To these <font color='#7a8080'>[complaining Jews the Lord]</font> had said, This is the true rest <font color='#7a8080'>[the way to true comfort and happiness]</font> that you shall give to the weary, and, This is the <font color='#7a8080'>[true]</font> refreshing—yet they would not listen <font color='#7a8080'>[to His teaching]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore the word of the Lord will be to them <font color='#7a8080'>[merely monotonous repeatings of]</font>: precept upon precept, precept upon precept, rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little—that they may go and fall backward, and be broken and snared and taken.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem!

<p><sup>15</sup> Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol (the place of the dead) we have an agreement—when the overflowing scourge passes through, it will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter.

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am laying in Zion for a foundation a Stone, a tested Stone, a precious Cornerstone of sure foundation; he who believes (trusts in, relies on, and adheres to that Stone) will not <i>be ashamed or</i> give way <i>or</i> hasten away <font color='#7a8080'>[in sudden panic]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plummet; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm the hiding place (the shelter).

<p><sup>18</sup> And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol (the place of the dead) shall not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, then you will be trodden down by it.

<p><sup>19</sup> As often as it passes through, it <font color='#7a8080'>[the enemy's scourge]</font> will take you; for morning by morning will it pass through, by day and by night. And it will be utter terror merely to hear <i>and</i> comprehend the report <i>and</i> the message of it <font color='#7a8080'>[but only hard treatment and dispersion will make you understand God's instruction]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[they will find that]</font> the bed is too short for a man to stretch himself on and the covering too narrow for him to wrap himself in. <font color='#7a8080'>[All their sources of confidence will fail them.]</font>

<p><sup>21</sup> For the Lord will rise up as on Mount Perazim, He will be wrathful as in the Valley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work, and bring to pass His act, His strange act.

<p><sup>22</sup> Now therefore do not be scoffers, lest the bands which bind you be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord God of hosts upon the whole land <i>and</i> the whole earth.

<p><sup>23</sup> Give ear and hear my <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah's]</font> voice; listen and hear my words.

<p><sup>24</sup> Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? Does he continue to plow and harrow the ground after it is smooth?

<p><sup>25</sup> When he has leveled its surface, does he not cast abroad <font color='#7a8080'>[the seed of]</font> dill <i>or</i> fennel and scatter cummin <font color='#7a8080'>[a seasoning]</font>, and put the wheat in rows, and barley in its intended place, and spelt <font color='#7a8080'>[an inferior kind of wheat]</font> as the border?

<p><sup>26</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[And he trains each of them correctly]</font> for his God instructs him correctly and teaches him.

<p><sup>27</sup> For dill is not threshed with a sharp threshing instrument, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; but dill is beaten off with a staff, and cummin with a rod <font color='#7a8080'>[by hand]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> Does one crush bread grain? No, he does not thresh it continuously. But when he has driven his cartwheel and his horses over it, he scatters it <font color='#7a8080'>[tossing it up to the wind]</font> without having crushed it.

<p><sup>29</sup> This also comes from the Lord of hosts, Who is wonderful in counsel <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> excellent in wisdom <i>and</i> effectual working.

<h4>29</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to Ariel <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>, to Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add yet another year; let the feasts run their round <font color='#7a8080'>[but only one year more]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> Then will I distress Ariel; and there shall be mourning and lamentation, yet she shall be to Me like an Ariel <font color='#7a8080'>[an altar hearth, a hearth of burning, the altar of God]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> And I will encamp against you round about; and I will hem you in with siege works and I will set up fortifications against you.

<p><sup>4</sup> And you shall be laid low <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>, speaking from beneath the ground, and your speech shall come humbly from the dust. And your voice shall be like that of a ghost <font color='#7a8080'>[produced by a medium]</font> coming from the earth, and your speech shall whisper <i>and</i> squeak as it chatters from the dust.

<p><sup>5</sup> But the multitude of your <font color='#7a8080'>[enemy]</font> strangers that assail you shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the ruthless <i>and</i> terrible ones like chaff that blows away. And in an instant, suddenly,

<p><sup>6</sup> You shall be visited <i>and</i> delivered by the Lord of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire.

<p><sup>7</sup> And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>, even all that fight against her and her stronghold and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.

<p><sup>8</sup> It shall be as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he wakens with his craving not satisfied; or as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he wakens and is faint, and his thirst is not quenched. So shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.

<p><sup>9</sup> Stop and wonder <font color='#7a8080'>[at this prophecy, if you choose, whether you understand it or not; soon you will witness the actual event]</font> and be confounded <font color='#7a8080'>[reluctantly]</font>! Blind yourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[now, if you choose; take your pleasure]</font> and then be blinded <font color='#7a8080'>[at the actual occurrence]</font>. They are drunk, but not from wine; they stagger, but not from strong drink <font color='#7a8080'>[but from spiritual stupor]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> For the Lord has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep. And He has closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, He has covered <i>and</i> muffled.

<p><sup>11</sup> And the vision of all this has become for you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, Read this, I pray you, he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.

<p><sup>12</sup> And when the book is given to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you, he says, I cannot read.

<p><sup>13</sup> And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near Me with their mouth and honor Me with their lips but remove their hearts <i>and</i> minds far from Me, and their fear <i>and</i> reverence for Me are a commandment of men that is learned by repetition <font color='#7a8080'>[without any thought as to the meaning]</font>,

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore, behold! I will again do marvelous things with this people, marvelous and astonishing things; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their discerning men will vanish <i>or</i> be hidden.

<p><sup>15</sup> Woe to those who <font color='#7a8080'>[seek to]</font> hide deep from the Lord their counsel, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? Who knows us?

<p><sup>16</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Oh, your perversity!]</font> You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be considered of no more account than the clay? Shall the thing that is made say of its maker, He did not make me; or the thing that is formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?

<p><sup>17</sup> Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field esteemed as a forest?

<p><sup>18</sup> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and out of obscurity <i>and</i> gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.

<p><sup>19</sup> The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice <i>and</i> exult in the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>20</sup> For the terrible one <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian enemy]</font> shall come to nought, and the scoffer shall cease, and all those who watch for iniquity <font color='#7a8080'>[as an occasion for accusation]</font> shall be cut off—

<p><sup>21</sup> Those who make a man an offender <i>and</i> bring condemnation upon him with a word, and lay a trap for him who upholds justice at the city gate, and thrust aside the innocent <i>and</i> truly righteous with an empty plea.

<p><sup>22</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord, Who redeemed Abraham <font color='#7a8080'>[out of Ur and idolatry]</font>, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not then be ashamed; not then shall his face become pale <font color='#7a8080'>[with fear and disappointment because of his children's degeneracy]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> For when he sees his children <font color='#7a8080'>[walking in the way of piety and virtue]</font>, the work of My hands in his midst, they will revere My name; they will revere the Holy One of Jacob and reverently fear the God of Israel.

<p><sup>24</sup> Those who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur <font color='#7a8080'>[discontentedly]</font> will accept instruction.

<h4>30</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to the rebellious children, says the Lord, who take counsel <i>and</i> carry out a plan, but not Mine, and who make a league <i>and</i> pour out a drink offering, but not of My Spirit, thus adding sin to sin;

<p><sup>2</sup> Who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked Me—to flee to the stronghold of Pharaoh <i>and</i> to strengthen themselves in his strength and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

<p><sup>3</sup> Therefore shall the strength <i>and</i> protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt be to your humiliation <i>and</i> confusion.

<p><sup>4</sup> For though <font color='#7a8080'>[Pharaoh's]</font> officials are at Zoan and his ambassadors arrive at Hanes <font color='#7a8080'>[in Egypt]</font>,

<p><sup>5</sup> Yet will all be ashamed because of a people <font color='#7a8080'>[the Egyptians]</font> who cannot profit them, who are not a help or benefit, but a shame and disgrace.

<p><sup>6</sup> A mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning the beasts of the South (the Negeb): Oh, the heavy burden, the load of treasures going to Egypt! Through a land of trouble and anguish, in which are lioness and lion, viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that will not <i>and</i> cannot profit them.

<p><sup>7</sup> For Egypt's help is worthless and toward no purpose. Therefore I have called her Rahab Who Sits Still.

<p><sup>8</sup> Now, go, write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book, that it may be as a witness for the time to come forevermore.

<p><sup>9</sup> For this is a rebellious people, faithless <i>and</i> lying sons, children who will not hear the law <i>and</i> instruction of the Lord;

<p><sup>10</sup> Who <font color='#7a8080'>[virtually]</font> say to the seers <font color='#7a8080'>[by their conduct]</font>, See not! and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us what is right! Speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceitful illusions.

<p><sup>11</sup> Get out of the true way, turn aside out of the path, cease holding up before us the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel: Because you despise <i>and</i> spurn this <font color='#7a8080'>[My]</font> word and trust in cunning <i>and</i> oppression, in crookedness <i>and</i> perverseness, and rely on them,

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore this iniquity <i>and</i> guilt will be to you like a broken section of a high wall, bulging out and ready <font color='#7a8080'>[at some distant day]</font> to fall, whose crash will <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> come suddenly <i>and</i> swiftly, in an instant.

<p><sup>14</sup> And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing so that there cannot be found among its pieces one large enough to carry coals of fire from the hearth or to dip water out of the cistern.

<p><sup>15</sup> For thus said the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: In returning <font color='#7a8080'>[to Me]</font> and resting <font color='#7a8080'>[in Me]</font> you shall be saved; in quietness and in <font color='#7a8080'>[trusting]</font> confidence shall be your strength. But you would not,

<p><sup>16</sup> And you said, No! We will speed <font color='#7a8080'>[our own course]</font> on horses! Therefore you will speed <font color='#7a8080'>[in flight from your enemies]</font>! You said, We will ride upon swift steeds <font color='#7a8080'>[doing our own way]</font>! Therefore will they who pursue you be swift, <font color='#7a8080'>[so swift that]</font>

<p><sup>17</sup> One thousand of you will flee at the threat of one of them; at the threat of five you will flee till you are left like a beacon <i>or</i> a flagpole on the top of a mountain, and like a signal on a hill.

<p><sup>18</sup> And therefore the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> waits <font color='#7a8080'>[expecting, looking, and longing]</font> to be gracious to you; and therefore He lifts Himself up, that He may have mercy on you <i>and</i> show loving-kindness to you. For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are all those who <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> wait for Him, who expect <i>and</i> look <i>and</i> long for Him <font color='#7a8080'>[for His victory, His favor, His love, His peace, His joy, and His matchless, unbroken companionship]</font>!

<p><sup>19</sup> O people who dwell in Zion at Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.

<p><sup>20</sup> And though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide Himself any more, but your eyes will constantly behold your Teacher.

<p><sup>21</sup> And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way; walk in it, when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left.

<p><sup>22</sup> Then you will defile your carved images overlaid with silver and your molten images plated with gold; you will cast them away as a filthy bloodstained cloth, and you will say to them, Be gone!

<p><sup>23</sup> Then will He give you rain for the seed with which you sow the soil, and bread grain from the produce of the ground, and it will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will feed in large pastures.

<p><sup>24</sup> The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory <i>and</i> salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and with fork.

<p><sup>25</sup> And upon every high mountain and upon every high hill there will be brooks and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter <font color='#7a8080'>[the day of the Lord]</font>, when the towers fall <font color='#7a8080'>[and all His enemies are destroyed]</font>.

<p><sup>26</sup> Moreover, the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days <font color='#7a8080'>[concentrated in one]</font>, in the day that the Lord binds up the hurt of His people, and heals their wound <font color='#7a8080'>[inflicted by Him because of their sins]</font>.

<p><sup>27</sup> Behold, the Name of the Lord comes from afar, burning with His anger, and in thick, rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.

<p><sup>28</sup> And His breath is like an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that causes them to err will be in the jaws of the people.

<p><sup>29</sup> You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart as when one marches in procession with a flute to go to the temple on the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.

<p><sup>30</sup> And the Lord shall cause His glorious voice to be heard and the descending blow of His arm to be seen, coming down with indignant anger and with the flame of a devouring fire, amid crashing blast <i>and</i> cloudburst, tempest, and hailstones.

<p><sup>31</sup> At the voice of the Lord the Assyrians will be stricken with dismay <i>and</i> terror, when He smites them with His rod.

<p><sup>32</sup> And every passing stroke of the staff of punishment <i>and</i> doom which the Lord lays upon them shall be to the sound of <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel's]</font> timbrels and lyres, when in battle He attacks <font color='#7a8080'>[Assyria]</font> with swinging <i>and</i> menacing arms.

<p><sup>33</sup> For Topheth <font color='#7a8080'>[a place of burning and abomination]</font> has already been laid out <i>and</i> long ago prepared; yes, for the <font color='#7a8080'>[Assyrian]</font> king <i>and</i> <font color='#7a8080'>[the god]</font> Molech it has been made ready, its pyre made deep <i>and</i> large, with fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, kindles it.

<h4>31</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek <i>and</i> consult the Lord!

<p><sup>2</sup> And yet He is wise and brings calamity and does not retract His words; He will arise against the house (the whole race) of evildoers and against the helpers of those who work iniquity.

<p><sup>3</sup> Now the Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses are flesh and not spirit; and when the Lord stretches out His hand, both <font color='#7a8080'>[Egypt]</font> who helps will stumble, and <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font> who is helped will fall, and they will all perish <i>and</i> be consumed together.

<p><sup>4</sup> For the Lord has said to me, As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey—and though a large band of shepherds is called out against him, he will not be terrified at their voice or daunted at their noise—so the Lord of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hills.

<p><sup>5</sup> Like birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; He will protect and deliver it, He will pass over <i>and</i> spare and preserve it.

<p><sup>6</sup> Return, O children of Israel, to Him against Whom you have so deeply plunged into revolt.

<p><sup>7</sup> For in that day every man of you will cast away <font color='#7a8080'>[in contempt and disgust]</font> his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your own hands have sinfully made for you.

<p><sup>8</sup> Then the Assyrian shall fall by a sword not of man; and a sword, not of men <font color='#7a8080'>[but of God]</font>, shall devour him. And he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be subjected to forced labor.

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[In his flight]</font> he shall pass beyond his rock <font color='#7a8080'>[refuge and stronghold]</font> because of terror; even his officers shall desert the standard in fear <i>and</i> panic, says the Lord, Whose fire is in Zion and Whose furnace is in Jerusalem.

<h4>32</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Behold, a King will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.

<p><sup>2</sup> And each one of them shall be like a hiding place from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a great rock in a weary land <font color='#7a8080'>[to those who turn to them]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed <i>or</i> dimmed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.

<p><sup>4</sup> And the mind of the rash will understand knowledge <i>and</i> have good judgment, and the tongue of the stammerers will speak readily and plainly.

<p><sup>5</sup> The fool (the unbeliever and the ungodly) will no more be called noble, nor the crafty <i>and</i> greedy <font color='#7a8080'>[for gain]</font> said to be bountiful <i>and</i> princely.

<p><sup>6</sup> For the fool speaks folly and his mind plans iniquity: practicing profane ungodliness and speaking error concerning the Lord, leaving the craving of the hungry unsatisfied and causing the drink of the thirsty to fail.

<p><sup>7</sup> The instruments <i>and</i> methods of the fraudulent <i>and</i> greedy <font color='#7a8080'>[for gain]</font> are evil; he devises wicked devices to ruin the poor <i>and</i> the lowly with lying words, even when the plea of the needy is just <i>and</i> right.

<p><sup>8</sup> But the noble, openhearted, <i>and</i> liberal man devises noble things; and he stands for what is noble, openhearted, <i>and</i> generous.

<p><sup>9</sup> Rise up, you women who are at ease! Hear my <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah's]</font> voice, you confident <i>and</i> careless daughters! Listen to what I am saying!

<p><sup>10</sup> In little more than a year you will be shaken with anxiety, you careless <i>and</i> complacent women; for the vintage will fail, and the ingathering will not come.

<p><sup>11</sup> Tremble, you women who are at ease! Shudder with fear, you complacent ones! Strip yourselves bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins <font color='#7a8080'>[in grief]</font>!

<p><sup>12</sup> They shall beat upon their breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,

<p><sup>13</sup> For the land of my people growing over with thorns and briers—yes, for all the houses of joy in the joyous city.

<p><sup>14</sup> For the palace shall be forsaken, the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watchtower shall become dens <font color='#7a8080'>[for wild animals]</font> endlessly, a joy for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks,

<p><sup>15</sup> Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is valued as a forest.

<p><sup>16</sup> Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation) will abide in the fruitful field.

<p><sup>17</sup> And the effect of righteousness will be peace <font color='#7a8080'>[internal and external]</font>, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and confident trust forever.

<p><sup>18</sup> My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.

<p><sup>19</sup> But it <font color='#7a8080'>[the wrath of the Lord]</font> shall hail, coming down overpoweringly on the forest <font color='#7a8080'>[the army of the Assyrians]</font>, and the capital city shall be utterly humbled <i>and</i> laid prostrate.

<p><sup>20</sup> Happy <i>and</i> fortunate are you who cast your seed upon all waters <font color='#7a8080'>[when the river overflows its banks; for the seed will sink into the mud and when the waters subside, the plant will spring up; you will find it after many days and reap an abundant harvest]</font>, you who safely send forth the ox and the donkey <font color='#7a8080'>[to range freely]</font>.

<h4>33</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Woe to you, O destroyer, you who were not yourself destroyed, who deal treacherously though they <font color='#7a8080'>[your victims]</font> did not deal treacherously with you! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have stopped dealing treacherously, they will deal treacherously with you.

<p><sup>2</sup> O Lord, be gracious to us; we have waited <font color='#7a8080'>[expectantly]</font> for You. Be the arm <font color='#7a8080'>[of Your servants—their strength and defense]</font> every morning, our salvation in the time of trouble.

<p><sup>3</sup> At the noise of the tumult <font color='#7a8080'>[caused by Your voice at which the enemy is overthrown]</font>, the peoples flee; at the lifting up of Yourself, nations are scattered.

<p><sup>4</sup> And the spoil <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Assyrians]</font> is gathered <font color='#7a8080'>[by the inhabitants of Jerusalem]</font> as the caterpillar gathers; as locusts leap <i>and</i> run to and fro, so <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jews spoil the Assyrians' forsaken camp as they]</font> leap upon it.

<p><sup>5</sup> The Lord is exalted, for He dwells on high; He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation).

<p><sup>6</sup> And there shall be stability in your times, an abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the reverent fear <i>and</i> worship of the Lord is your treasure <i>and</i> His.

<p><sup>7</sup> Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

<p><sup>8</sup> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases. The enemy has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities <i>and</i> <i>the witnesses</i>, he regards no man.

<p><sup>9</sup> The land mourns and languishes, Lebanon is confounded and <font color='#7a8080'>[its luxuriant verdure]</font> withers away; Sharon <font color='#7a8080'>[a fertile pasture region south of Mount Carmel]</font> is like a desert, and Bashan <font color='#7a8080'>[a broad, fertile plateau east of the Jordan River]</font> and <font color='#7a8080'>[Mount]</font> Carmel shake off their leaves.

<p><sup>10</sup> Now will I arise, says the Lord. Now will I lift up Myself; now will I be exalted.

<p><sup>11</sup> You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that consumes you.

<p><sup>12</sup> And the people will be burned as if to lime, like thorns cut down that are burned in the fire.

<p><sup>13</sup> Hear, you who are far off <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font>, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge My might!

<p><sup>14</sup> The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the godless ones. <font color='#7a8080'>[They cry]</font> Who among us can dwell with that devouring fire? Who among us can dwell with those everlasting burnings?

<p><sup>15</sup> He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, who despises gain from fraud <i>and</i> from oppression, who shakes his hand free from the taking of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed and shuts his eyes to avoid looking upon evil.

<p><sup>16</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Such a man]</font> will dwell on the heights; his place of defense will be the fortresses of rocks; his bread will be given him; water for him will be sure.

<p><sup>17</sup> Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; <font color='#7a8080'>[your eyes]</font> will behold a land of wide distances that stretches afar.

<p><sup>18</sup> Your mind will meditate on the terror: <font color='#7a8080'>[asking]</font> Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed the tribute? Where is he who counted the towers?

<p><sup>19</sup> You will see no more the fierce <i>and</i> insolent people, a people of a speech too deep <i>and</i> obscure to be comprehended, of a strange <i>and</i> stammering tongue that you cannot understand.

<p><sup>20</sup> Look upon Zion, the city of our set feasts <i>and</i> solemnities! Your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be pulled up, neither shall any of its cords be broken.

<p><sup>21</sup> But there the Lord will be for us in majesty <i>and</i> splendor a place of broad rivers and streams, where no oar-propelled boat can go, and no mighty <i>and</i> stately ship can pass.

<p><sup>22</sup> For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King; He will save us.

<p><sup>23</sup> Your hoisting ropes hang loose; they cannot strengthen <i>and</i> hold firm the foot of their mast or keep the sail spread out. Then will prey and spoil in abundance be divided; even the lame will take the prey.

<p><sup>24</sup> And no inhabitant <font color='#7a8080'>[of Zion]</font> will say, I am sick; the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity <i>and</i> guilt.

<h4>34</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Come near, you nations, to hear; and hearken, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it; the world, and all things that come forth from it.

<p><sup>2</sup> For the Lord is indignant against all nations, and His wrath is against all their host. He has utterly doomed them, He has given them over to slaughter.

<p><sup>3</sup> Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall rise, and the mountains shall flow with their blood.

<p><sup>4</sup> All the host of the heavens shall be dissolved <i>and</i> crumble away, and the skies shall be rolled together like a scroll; and all their host <font color='#7a8080'>[the stars and the planets]</font> shall drop like a faded leaf from the vine, and like a withered fig from the fig tree.

<p><sup>5</sup> Because My sword has been bathed <i>and</i> equipped in heaven, behold, it shall come down upon Edom <font color='#7a8080'>[the descendants of Esau]</font>, upon the people whom I have doomed for judgment.

<p><sup>6</sup> The sword of the Lord is filled with blood <font color='#7a8080'>[of sacrifices]</font>, it is gorged <i>and</i> greased with fatness—with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah <font color='#7a8080'>[capital of Edom]</font> and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

<p><sup>7</sup> And the wild oxen shall fall with them, and the <font color='#7a8080'>[young]</font> bullocks with the <font color='#7a8080'>[old and mighty]</font> bulls; and their land shall be drunk <i>and</i> soaked with blood, and their dust made rich with fatness.

<p><sup>8</sup> For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense, for the cause of Zion.

<p><sup>9</sup> And the streams <font color='#7a8080'>[of Edom]</font> will be turned into pitch and its dust into brimstone, and its land will become burning pitch.

<p><sup>10</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The burning of Edom]</font> shall not be quenched night or day; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.

<p><sup>11</sup> But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it; the owl <i>and</i> the bittern and the raven will dwell in it. And He will stretch over it <font color='#7a8080'>[Edom]</font> the measuring line of confusion and the plummet stones of chaos <font color='#7a8080'>[over its nobles]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> They shall call its nobles to proclaim the kingdom, but nothing shall be there, and all its princes shall be no more.

<p><sup>13</sup> And thorns shall come up in its palaces <i>and</i> strongholds, nettles and brambles in its fortresses; and it shall be a habitation for jackals, an abode for ostriches.

<p><sup>14</sup> And the wild beasts of the desert will meet here with howling creatures <font color='#7a8080'>[wolves and hyenas]</font> and the <font color='#7a8080'>[shaggy]</font> wild goat will call to his fellow; the night monster will settle there and find a place of rest.

<p><sup>15</sup> There shall the arrow snake make her nest and lay her eggs and hatch them and gather her young under her shade; there shall the kites be gathered <font color='#7a8080'>[also to breed]</font> every one with its mate.

<p><sup>16</sup> Seek out of the book of the Lord and read: not one of these <font color='#7a8080'>[details of prophecy]</font> shall fail, none shall want <i>and</i> lack her mate <font color='#7a8080'>[in fulfillment]</font>. For the mouth <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Lord]</font> has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.

<p><sup>17</sup> And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has portioned <font color='#7a8080'>[Edom]</font> to <font color='#7a8080'>[the wild beasts]</font> by measuring line. They shall possess it forever; from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.

<h4>35</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the rose <i>and</i> the autumn crocus.

<p><sup>2</sup> It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of <font color='#7a8080'>[Mount]</font> Carmel and <font color='#7a8080'>[the plain]</font> of Sharon. They shall see the glory of the Lord, the majesty <i>and</i> splendor <i>and</i> excellency of our God.

<p><sup>3</sup> Strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble <i>and</i> tottering knees.

<p><sup>4</sup> Say to those who are of a fearful <i>and</i> hasty heart, Be strong, fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance; with the recompense of God He will come and save you.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then shall the lame man leap like a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for joy. For waters shall break forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.

<p><sup>7</sup> And the burning sand <i>and</i> the mirage shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; in the haunt of jackals, where they lay resting, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

<p><sup>8</sup> And a highway shall be there, and a way; and it shall be called the Holy Way. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for the redeemed; the wayfaring men, yes, the simple ones <i>and</i> fools, shall not err in it <i>and</i> lose their way.

<p><sup>9</sup> No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it; they shall not be found there. But the redeemed shall walk on it.

<p><sup>10</sup> And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

<h4>36</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh <font color='#7a8080'>[the military official]</font> from Lachish <font color='#7a8080'>[the Judean fortress commanding the road from Egypt]</font> to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a great army. And he stood by the canal of the Upper Pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then came out to meet him Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the <font color='#7a8080'>[royal]</font> household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recording historian.

<p><sup>4</sup> And the Rabshakeh said to them, Say to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What reason for confidence is this in which you trust?

<p><sup>5</sup> Do you suppose that mere words of the lips can pass for warlike counsel and strength? Now in whom do you trust <i>and</i> on whom do you rely, that you rebel against me?

<p><sup>6</sup> Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised <i>and</i> broken reed, Egypt, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust <i>and</i> rely on him.

<p><sup>7</sup> But if you say to me, We trust in <i>and</i> rely on the Lord our God—is it not He Whose high places and Whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?

<p><sup>8</sup> Now therefore, I pray you, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria <i>and</i> give him pledges, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them.

<p><sup>9</sup> How then can you repulse the attack of a single captain of the least of my master's servants, when you put your reliance on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

<p><sup>10</sup> Moreover, is it without the Lord that I have now come up against this land to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, We pray you, speak to your servants in the Aramaic <i>or</i> Syrian language, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in the language of the Jews in the hearing of the people on the wall.

<p><sup>12</sup> But the Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you? Has he not sent me to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?

<p><sup>13</sup> Then the Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the language of the Jews: Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!

<p><sup>14</sup> Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.

<p><sup>15</sup> Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in <i>and</i> rely on the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

<p><sup>16</sup> Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; and eat every one from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree and drink every one the water of his own cistern,

<p><sup>17</sup> Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

<p><sup>18</sup> Beware lest Hezekiah persuade <i>and</i> mislead you by saying, The Lord will deliver us. Has any one of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

<p><sup>19</sup> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad <font color='#7a8080'>[in Syria]</font>? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim <font color='#7a8080'>[a place from which the Assyrians brought colonists to inhabit evacuated Samaria]</font>? And have <font color='#7a8080'>[the gods]</font> delivered Samaria <font color='#7a8080'>[capital of the ten northern tribes of Israel]</font> out of my hand?

<p><sup>20</sup> Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land out of my hand, that <font color='#7a8080'>[you should think that]</font> the Lord can deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

<p><sup>21</sup> But they kept still and answered him not a word, for the king's <font color='#7a8080'>[Hezekiah's]</font> command was, Do not answer him.

<p><sup>22</sup> Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recording historian came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh <font color='#7a8080'>[the Assyrian military official]</font>.

<h4>37</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And when King Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>2</sup> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the <font color='#7a8080'>[royal]</font> household, and Shebna the secretary, and the older priests, clothed with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

<p><sup>3</sup> And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble <i>and</i> distress and of rebuke and of disgrace; for children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.

<p><sup>4</sup> It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to mock, reproach, insult, <i>and</i> defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant <font color='#7a8080'>[of His people]</font> that is left.

<p><sup>5</sup> So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

<p><sup>6</sup> And Isaiah said to them, You shall say to your master, Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled <i>and</i> blasphemed Me.

<p><sup>7</sup> Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

<p><sup>8</sup> So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah <font color='#7a8080'>[a fortified city of Judah]</font>; for he had heard that the king had departed from Lachish.

<p><sup>9</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[Sennacherib king of Assyria]</font> heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

<p><sup>10</sup> Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: Let not your God in Whom you trust deceive you by saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

<p><sup>11</sup> Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered?

<p><sup>12</sup> Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my predecessors have destroyed, as Gozan, Haran <font color='#7a8080'>[of Mesopotamia]</font>, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?

<p><sup>13</sup> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad <font color='#7a8080'>[of northern Syria]</font>, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?

<p><sup>14</sup> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord.

<p><sup>15</sup> And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:

<p><sup>16</sup> O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, Who <font color='#7a8080'>[in symbol]</font> are enthroned above the cherubim <font color='#7a8080'>[of the ark in the temple]</font>, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.

<p><sup>17</sup> Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock, reproach, insult, <i>and</i> defy the living God.

<p><sup>18</sup> It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands

<p><sup>19</sup> And have cast the gods of those peoples into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.

<p><sup>20</sup> Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know (understand and realize) that You are the Lord, even You only.

<p><sup>21</sup> Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

<p><sup>22</sup> This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him: The Virgin Daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the Daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you.

<p><sup>23</sup> Whom have you mocked and reviled <font color='#7a8080'>[insulted and blasphemed]</font>? And against Whom have you raised your voice and haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!

<p><sup>24</sup> By your servants you have mocked, reproached, insulted, <i>and</i> defied the Lord, and you have said, With my many chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the inner recesses of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars <i>and</i> its choicest cypress trees; I came to its remotest height, its most luxuriant <i>and</i> dense forest;

<p><sup>25</sup> I dug wells and drank foreign waters, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the rivers <font color='#7a8080'>[the Nile streams]</font> of Egypt.

<p><sup>26</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But, says the God of Israel]</font> have you not heard that I purposed to do it long ago, that I planned it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that you <font color='#7a8080'>[king of Assyria]</font> should <font color='#7a8080'>[be My instrument to]</font> lay waste fortified cities, making them ruinous heaps.

<p><sup>27</sup> Therefore their inhabitants had little power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were like the grass of the field and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops and like a field of grain blasted before it is grown <i>or</i> is in stalk.

<p><sup>28</sup> But I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> know your sitting down and your going out and your coming in and your raging against Me.

<p><sup>29</sup> Because your raging against Me and your arrogance <i>and</i> careless ease have come to My ears, therefore will I put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way you came.

<p><sup>30</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[now, Hezekiah, says the Lord]</font> this shall be the sign <font color='#7a8080'>[of these things]</font> to you: you shall eat this year what grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from the same. And in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.

<p><sup>31</sup> And the remnant that has survived of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.

<p><sup>32</sup> For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and a band that survives out of Mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.

<p><sup>33</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow here or come before it with shield or cast up a siege mound against it.

<p><sup>34</sup> By the way that he came, by the same way he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, says the Lord.

<p><sup>35</sup> For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.

<p><sup>36</sup> And the Angel of the Lord went forth, and slew 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when <font color='#7a8080'>[the living]</font> arose early in the morning, behold, all these were dead bodies.

<p><sup>37</sup> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.

<p><sup>38</sup> And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Armenia <i>or</i> Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

<h4>38</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> In those days King Hezekiah of Judah became ill and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said, Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.

<p><sup>2</sup> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord

<p><sup>3</sup> And said, Remember <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> now, O Lord, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in faithfulness <i>and</i> in truth, with a whole heart <font color='#7a8080'>[absolutely devoted to You]</font>, and have done what is good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,

<p><sup>5</sup> Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add to your life fifteen years.

<p><sup>6</sup> And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> And this will be the sign to you from the Lord that the Lord will do this thing that He has spoken:

<p><sup>8</sup> Behold, I will turn the shadow <font color='#7a8080'>[denoting the time of day]</font> on the steps <i>or</i> degrees, which has gone down on the steps <i>or</i> sundial of Ahaz, backward ten steps <i>or</i> degrees. And the sunlight turned back ten steps on the steps on which it had gone down.

<p><sup>9</sup> This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:

<p><sup>10</sup> I said, In the noontide <i>and</i> tranquillity of my days I must depart; I am to pass through the gates of Sheol (the place of the dead), deprived of the remainder of my years.

<p><sup>11</sup> I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more among the inhabitants of the world.

<p><sup>12</sup> My <font color='#7a8080'>[fleshly]</font> dwelling is plucked up <i>and</i> is removed from me like a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up my life as a weaver <font color='#7a8080'>[rolls up the finished web]</font>; <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> cuts me free from the loom; from day to night You bring me to an end.

<p><sup>13</sup> I thought <i>and</i> quieted myself until morning. Like a lion He breaks all my bones; from day to night You bring me to an end.

<p><sup>14</sup> Like a twittering swallow <i>or</i> a crane, so do I chirp <i>and</i> chatter; I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary <i>and</i> dim with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; take my side <i>and</i> be my security <font color='#7a8080'>[as of a debtor being sent to prison]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> But what can I say? For He has both spoken to me and He Himself has done it. I must go softly <font color='#7a8080'>[as in solemn procession]</font> all my years <i>and</i> my sleep has fled because of the bitterness of my soul.

<p><sup>16</sup> O Lord, by these things men live; and in all these is the life of my spirit. O give me back my health and make me live!

<p><sup>17</sup> Behold, it was for my peace that I had intense bitterness; but You have loved back my life from the pit of corruption <i>and</i> nothingness, for You have cast all my sins behind Your back.

<p><sup>18</sup> For Sheol (the place of the dead) cannot confess <i>and</i> reach out the hand to You, death cannot praise <i>and</i> rejoice in You; they who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness <font color='#7a8080'>[to Your promises; their probation is at an end, their destiny is sealed]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> The living, the living—they shall thank <i>and</i> praise You, as I do this day; the father shall make known to the children Your faithfulness <i>and</i> Your truth.

<p><sup>20</sup> The Lord is ready to save (deliver) me; therefore we will sing my songs with <font color='#7a8080'>[my]</font> stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>21</sup> Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, that he may recover.

<p><sup>22</sup> Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?

<h4>39</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent <font color='#7a8080'>[messengers with]</font> letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.

<p><sup>2</sup> And Hezekiah was glad <i>and</i> welcomed them and showed them the house of his spices <i>and</i> precious things—the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious ointment, all the house of his armor <i>and</i> his jewels, and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

<p><sup>3</sup> Then came Isaiah the prophet to King Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say? From where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They came to me from a far country, even from Babylon.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then Isaiah said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:

<p><sup>6</sup> Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your predecessors have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the Lord.

<p><sup>7</sup> And some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

<p><sup>8</sup> Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good. And he added, For there will be peace and faithfulness <font color='#7a8080'>[to His promises to us]</font> in my days.

<h4>40</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Comfort, comfort My people, says your God.

<p><sup>2</sup> Speak tenderly to the heart of Jerusalem, and cry to her that her time of service <i>and</i> her warfare are ended, that <font color='#7a8080'>[her punishment is accepted and]</font> her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received <font color='#7a8080'>[punishment]</font> from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.

<p><sup>3</sup> A voice of one who cries: Prepare in the wilderness the way of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[clear away the obstacles]</font>; make straight <i>and</i> smooth in the desert a highway for our God!

<p><sup>4</sup> Every valley shall be lifted <i>and</i> filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked <i>and</i> uneven shall be made straight <i>and</i> level, and the rough places a plain.

<p><sup>5</sup> And the glory (majesty and splendor) of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.

<p><sup>6</sup> A voice says, Cry <font color='#7a8080'>[prophesy]</font>! And I said, What shall I cry? <font color='#7a8080'>[The voice answered, Proclaim:]</font> All flesh is as frail as grass, and all that makes it attractive <font color='#7a8080'>[its kindness, its goodwill, its mercy from God, its glory and comeliness, however good]</font> is transitory, like the flower of the field.

<p><sup>7</sup> The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the Lord blows upon it; surely <font color='#7a8080'>[all]</font> the people are like grass.

<p><sup>8</sup> The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.

<p><sup>9</sup> O you who bring good tidings to Zion, get up to the high mountain. O you who bring good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength, lift it up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

<p><sup>10</sup> Behold, the Lord God will come with might, and His arm will rule for Him. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.

<p><sup>11</sup> He will feed His flock like a shepherd: He will gather the lambs in His arm, He will carry them in His bosom and will gently lead those that have their young.

<p><sup>12</sup> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, marked off the heavens with a <font color='#7a8080'>[nine-inch]</font> span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?

<p><sup>13</sup> Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, or as His counselor has taught Him?

<p><sup>14</sup> With whom did He take counsel, that instruction might be given Him? Who taught Him the path of justice and taught Him knowledge and showed Him the way of understanding?

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket and are counted as small dust on the scales; behold, He takes up the isles like a very little thing.

<p><sup>16</sup> And all Lebanon's <font color='#7a8080'>[forests]</font> cannot supply sufficient fuel, nor all its wild beasts furnish victims enough to burn sacrifices <font color='#7a8080'>[worthy of the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>17</sup> All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and emptiness (waste, futility, and worthlessness).

<p><sup>18</sup> To whom then will you liken God? Or with what likeness will you compare Him?

<p><sup>19</sup> The graven image! A workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it.

<p><sup>20</sup> He who is so impoverished that he has no offering <i>or</i> oblation <i>or</i> rich gift to give <font color='#7a8080'>[to his god is constrained to make a wooden offering, an idol; so he]</font> chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks out a skillful craftsman to carve <i>and</i> set up an image that will not totter <i>or</i> deteriorate.

<p><sup>21</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[You worshipers of idols, you are without excuse.]</font> Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? <font color='#7a8080'>[These things ought to convince you of God's omnipotence and of the folly of bowing to idols.]</font> Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

<p><sup>22</sup> It is God Who sits above the circle (the horizon) of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; it is He Who stretches out the heavens like <font color='#7a8080'>[gauze]</font> curtains and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,

<p><sup>23</sup> Who brings dignitaries to nothing, Who makes the judges <i>and</i> rulers of the earth as chaos (emptiness, falsity, and futility).

<p><sup>24</sup> Yes, these men are scarcely planted, scarcely are they sown, scarcely does their stock take root in the earth, when <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> blows upon them and they wither, and the whirlwind <i>or</i> tempest takes them away like stubble.

<p><sup>25</sup> To whom then will you liken Me, that I should be equal to him? says the Holy One.

<p><sup>26</sup> Lift up your eyes on high and see! Who has created these? He Who brings out their host by number and calls them all by name; through the greatness of His might and because He is strong in power, not one is missing <i>or</i> lacks anything.

<p><sup>27</sup> Why, O Jacob, do you say, and declare, O Israel, My way <i>and</i> my lot are hidden from the Lord, and my right is passed over without regard from my God?

<p><sup>28</sup> Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint or grow weary; there is no searching of His understanding.

<p><sup>29</sup> He gives power to the faint <i>and</i> weary, and to him who has no might He increases strength <font color='#7a8080'>[causing it to multiply and making it to abound]</font>.

<p><sup>30</sup> Even youths shall faint and be weary, and <font color='#7a8080'>[selected]</font> young men shall feebly stumble <i>and</i> fall exhausted;

<p><sup>31</sup> But those who wait for the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[who expect, look for, and hope in Him]</font> shall change <i>and</i> renew their strength <i>and</i> power; they shall lift their wings <i>and</i> mount up <font color='#7a8080'>[close to God]</font> as eagles <font color='#7a8080'>[mount up to the sun]</font>; they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint <i>or</i> become tired.

<h4>41</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Listen in silence before Me, O islands <i>and</i> regions bordering on the sea! And let the people gather <i>and</i> renew their strength <font color='#7a8080'>[for the argument; let them offer their strongest arguments]</font>! Let them come near, then let them speak; let us come near together for judgment <font color='#7a8080'>[and decide the point at issue between us concerning the enemy advancing from the east]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> Who has roused up one <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus]</font> from the east, whom He calls in righteousness to His service <i>and</i> whom victory meets at every step? He <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> subdues nations before him and makes him ruler over kings. He turns them to dust with the sword <font color='#7a8080'>[of Cyrus]</font>, and to driven straw <i>and</i> chaff with his bow.

<p><sup>3</sup> He <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus]</font> pursues them and passes safely <i>and</i> unhindered, even by a way his feet had not trod <i>and</i> so swiftly that his feet do not touch the ground.

<p><sup>4</sup> Who has prepared and done this, calling forth <i>and</i> guiding the destinies of the generations <font color='#7a8080'>[of the nations]</font> from the beginning? I, the Lord—the first <font color='#7a8080'>[existing before history began]</font> and with the last <font color='#7a8080'>[an ever-present, unchanging God]</font>—I am He.

<p><sup>5</sup> The islands <i>and</i> coastlands have seen and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They draw near and come;

<p><sup>6</sup> They help every one his neighbor and say to his brother <font color='#7a8080'>[in his tiresome idol making]</font>, Be of good courage!

<p><sup>7</sup> So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, <i>and</i> he who smooths <font color='#7a8080'>[the metal]</font> with the hammer <font color='#7a8080'>[encourages]</font> him who smites the anvil, saying of the soldering, That is good! And he fastens it with nails so that it cannot be moved.

<p><sup>8</sup> But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham My friend,

<p><sup>9</sup> You whom I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> have taken from the ends of the earth and have called from the corners of it, and said to you, You are My servant—I have chosen you and not cast you off <font color='#7a8080'>[even though you are exiled]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> Fear not <font color='#7a8080'>[there is nothing to fear]</font>, for I am with you; do not look around you in terror <i>and</i> be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen <i>and</i> harden you to difficulties, yes, I will help you; yes, I will hold you up <i>and</i> retain you with My <font color='#7a8080'>[victorious]</font> right hand of rightness <i>and</i> justice.

<p><sup>11</sup> Behold, all they who are enraged <i>and</i> inflamed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; they who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish.

<p><sup>12</sup> You shall seek those who contend with you but shall not find them; they who war against you shall be as nothing, as nothing at all.

<p><sup>13</sup> For I the Lord your God hold your right hand; I am the Lord, Who says to you, Fear not; I will help you!

<p><sup>14</sup> Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold, I will make you to be a new, sharp, threshing instrument which has teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, and shall make the hills like chaff.

<p><sup>16</sup> You shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest <i>or</i> whirlwind shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in the Lord, you shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>17</sup> The poor and needy are seeking water when there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I the Lord will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

<p><sup>18</sup> I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

<p><sup>19</sup> I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the wild olive; I will set the cypress in the desert, the plane <font color='#7a8080'>[tree]</font> and the pine <font color='#7a8080'>[tree]</font> together,

<p><sup>20</sup> That men may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the Lord has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.

<p><sup>21</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[You idols made by men's hands, prove your divinity!]</font> Produce your cause <font color='#7a8080'>[set forth your case]</font>, says the Lord. Bring forth your strong proofs, says the King of Jacob.

<p><sup>22</sup> Let them bring them forth and tell us what is to happen. Let them tell us the former things, what they are, that we may consider them and know the outcome of them; or declare to us the things to come.

<p><sup>23</sup> Tell us the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; yes, do good or do evil <font color='#7a8080'>[something or other]</font>, that we may stare in astonishment <i>and</i> be dismayed as we behold <font color='#7a8080'>[the miracle]</font> together!

<p><sup>24</sup> Behold, you <font color='#7a8080'>[idols]</font> are nothing, and your work is nothing! The worshiper who chooses you is an abomination <font color='#7a8080'>[extremely disgusting and shamefully vile in God's sight]</font>.

<p><sup>25</sup> I have raised up <i>and</i> impelled to action one from the north <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus]</font>, and he comes; from the rising of the sun he calls upon My name <font color='#7a8080'>[recognizing that his victories have been granted to him by Me]</font>. And he shall tread upon rulers <i>and</i> deputies as upon mortar and as the potter treads clay. <font color='#7a8080'>[He comes with the suddenness of a comet, but none of the idol oracles of the nations has anticipated it.]</font>

<p><sup>26</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[What idol]</font> has declared this from the beginning, that we could know? And beforetime, that we could say that he is <font color='#7a8080'>[unquestionably]</font> right? Yes, there is none who declares it, yes, there is none who proclaims it; yes, <font color='#7a8080'>[for the truth is, O you dumb idols]</font> there is none who hears you speak!

<p><sup>27</sup> I <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> first gave to Zion the announcement, Behold, <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jews will be restored to their own land, and the man Cyrus shall be raised up who will deliver them]</font> behold them! And to Jerusalem I gave a herald <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah]</font> bringing the good news.

<p><sup>28</sup> For I look <font color='#7a8080'>[upon the heathen prophets and the priests of pagan practices]</font> and there is no man among them <font color='#7a8080'>[who could predict these events]</font>, and among these <font color='#7a8080'>[idols]</font> there is no counselor who, when I ask of him, can answer a word.

<p><sup>29</sup> Behold, these <font color='#7a8080'>[pagan prophets and priests]</font> are all emptiness (falseness and futility)! Their works are worthless; their molten images are empty wind (confusion and waste).

<h4>42</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Behold my Servant, Whom I uphold, My elect in Whom My soul delights! I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice <i>and</i> right <i>and</i> reveal truth to the nations.

<p><sup>2</sup> He will not cry or shout aloud or cause His voice to be heard in the street.

<p><sup>3</sup> A bruised reed He will not break, and a dimly burning wick He will not quench; He will bring forth justice in truth.

<p><sup>4</sup> He will not fail <i>or</i> become weak or be crushed <i>and</i> discouraged till He has established justice in the earth; and the islands <i>and</i> coastal regions shall wait hopefully for Him <i>and</i> expect His direction <i>and</i> law.

<p><sup>5</sup> Thus says God the Lord—He Who created the heavens and stretched them forth, He Who spread abroad the earth and that which comes out of it, He Who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it:

<p><sup>6</sup> I the Lord have called You <font color='#7a8080'>[the Messiah]</font> for a righteous purpose <i>and</i> in righteousness; I will take You by the hand and will keep You; I will give You for a covenant to the people <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>, for a light to the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[Gentiles]</font>,

<p><sup>7</sup> To open the eyes of the blind, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness from the prison.

<p><sup>8</sup> I am the Lord; that is My name! And My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images.

<p><sup>9</sup> Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.

<p><sup>10</sup> Sing to the Lord a new song, and His praise from the end of the earth! You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, the islands <i>and</i> coastal regions and the inhabitants of them <font color='#7a8080'>[sing a song such as has never been heard in the heathen world]</font>!

<p><sup>11</sup> Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voices, the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of the rock <font color='#7a8080'>[Sela or Petra]</font> sing; let them shout from the tops of the mountains!

<p><sup>12</sup> Let them give glory to the Lord and declare His praise in the islands <i>and</i> coastal regions.

<p><sup>13</sup> The Lord will go forth like a mighty man, He will rouse up His zealous indignation <i>and</i> vengeance like a warrior; He will cry, yes, He will shout aloud, He will do mightily against His enemies.

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Thus says the Lord]</font> I have for a long time held My peace, I have been still and restrained Myself. Now I will cry out like a woman in travail, I will gasp and pant together.

<p><sup>15</sup> I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their herbage; I will turn the rivers into islands, and I will dry up the pools.

<p><sup>16</sup> And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness into light before them and make uneven places into a plain. These things I have determined to do <font color='#7a8080'>[for them]</font>; and I will not leave them forsaken.

<p><sup>17</sup> They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, who trust in graven images, who say to molten images, You are our gods.

<p><sup>18</sup> Hear, you deaf! And look, you blind, that you may see!

<p><sup>19</sup> Who is blind but My servant <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>? Or deaf like My messenger whom I send? Who is blind like the one who is at peace with Me <font color='#7a8080'>[who has been admitted to covenant relationship with Me]</font>? Yes, who is blind like the Lord's servant?

<p><sup>20</sup> You have seen many things, but you do not observe <i>or</i> apprehend their true meaning. His ears are open, but he hears not!

<p><sup>21</sup> It was the Lord's pleasure for His righteousness' sake <font color='#7a8080'>[in accordance with a steadfast and consistent purpose]</font> to magnify instruction <i>and</i> revelation and glorify them.

<p><sup>22</sup> But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes and hidden in houses of bondage. They have become a prey, with no one to deliver them, a spoil, with no one to say, Restore them! <font color='#7a8080'>[This shows the condition that will ensue as Israel's punishment for not recognizing the Servant of the Lord and the day of His visit among them.]</font> <font color='#7a8080'>[Luke19:41-44.]</font>

<p><sup>23</sup> Who is there among you who will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear in the time to come?

<p><sup>24</sup> Who gave up Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[the kingdom of Judah]</font> for spoil, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the kingdom of]</font> Israel to the robbers? Was it not the Lord, He against Whom we <font color='#7a8080'>[of Judah]</font> have sinned and in Whose ways they <font color='#7a8080'>[of Israel]</font> would not walk, neither were they obedient to His law <i>or</i> His teaching?

<p><sup>25</sup> Therefore He poured out upon <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> the fierceness of His anger and the strength of battle. And it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not <font color='#7a8080'>[the lesson of repentance which the Assyrian conquest was intended to teach]</font>; it burned him, but he did not lay it to heart.

<h4>43</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> But now <font color='#7a8080'>[in spite of past judgments for Israel's sins]</font>, thus says the Lord, He Who created you, O Jacob, and He Who formed you, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed you <font color='#7a8080'>[ransomed you by paying a price instead of leaving you captives]</font>; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.

<p><sup>2</sup> When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned <i>or</i> scorched, nor will the flame kindle upon you.

<p><sup>3</sup> For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt <font color='#7a8080'>[to the Babylonians]</font> for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba <font color='#7a8080'>[a province of Ethiopia]</font> in exchange <font color='#7a8080'>[for your release]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> Because you are precious in My sight and honored, and because I love you, I will give men in return for you and peoples in exchange for your life.

<p><sup>5</sup> Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east <font color='#7a8080'>[where they are dispersed]</font> and gather you from the west.

<p><sup>6</sup> I will say to the north, Give up! and to the south, Keep not back. Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth—

<p><sup>7</sup> Even everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory, whom I have formed, whom I have made.

<p><sup>8</sup> Bring forth the blind people who have eyes and the deaf who have ears.

<p><sup>9</sup> Let all the nations be gathered together and let the peoples be assembled. Who among <font color='#7a8080'>[the idolaters]</font> could predict this <font color='#7a8080'>[that Cyrus would be the deliverer of Israel]</font> and show us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified, or let them hear and acknowledge, It is the truth.

<p><sup>10</sup> You are My witnesses, says the Lord, and My servant whom I have chosen, that you may know Me, believe Me <i>and</i> remain steadfast to Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me.

<p><sup>11</sup> I, even I, am the Lord, and besides Me there is no Savior.

<p><sup>12</sup> I have declared <font color='#7a8080'>[the future]</font> and have saved <font color='#7a8080'>[the nation in times of danger]</font>, and I have shown <font color='#7a8080'>[that I am God]</font>—when there was no strange and alien god among you; therefore you are My witnesses, says the Lord, that I am God.

<p><sup>13</sup> Yes, from the time of the first existence of day <i>and</i> from this day forth I am He; and there is no one who can deliver out of My hand. I will work, and who can hinder <i>or</i> reverse it?

<p><sup>14</sup> Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent <font color='#7a8080'>[one]</font> to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, <font color='#7a8080'>[with]</font> all their nobles, even the Chaldeans, into the ships over which they rejoiced.

<p><sup>15</sup> I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.

<p><sup>16</sup> Thus says the Lord, Who makes a way through the sea and a path through the mighty waters,

<p><sup>17</sup> Who brings forth chariot and horse, army and mighty warrior. They lie down together, they cannot rise; they are extinguished, they are quenched like a lampwick:

<p><sup>18</sup> Do not <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remember the former things; neither consider the things of old.

<p><sup>19</sup> Behold, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs forth; do you not perceive <i>and</i> know it <i>and</i> will you not give heed to it? I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.

<p><sup>20</sup> The beasts of the field honor Me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I give waters in the wilderness <i>and</i> rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen,

<p><sup>21</sup> The people I formed for Myself, that they may set forth My praise <font color='#7a8080'>[and they shall do it]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> Yet you have not called upon Me <font color='#7a8080'>[much less toiled for Me]</font>, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel!

<p><sup>23</sup> You have not brought Me your sheep <i>and</i> goats for burnt offerings, or honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not required you to serve with an offering <i>or</i> treated you as a slave by demanding tribute or wearied you with offering incense.

<p><sup>24</sup> You have not bought Me sweet cane with money, or satiated Me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have only burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.

<p><sup>25</sup> I, even I, am He Who blots out <i>and</i> cancels your transgressions, for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.

<p><sup>26</sup> Put Me in remembrance <font color='#7a8080'>[remind Me of your merits]</font>; let us plead <i>and</i> argue together. Set forth your case, that you may be justified (proved right).

<p><sup>27</sup> Your first father <font color='#7a8080'>[Jacob, in particular]</font> sinned, and your teachers <font color='#7a8080'>[the priests and the prophets—your mediators]</font> transgressed against Me.

<p><sup>28</sup> And so I will profane the chief ones of the sanctuary and will deliver Jacob to the curse (the ban, a solemn anathema or excommunication) and <font color='#7a8080'>[will subject]</font> Israel to reproaches <i>and</i> reviling.

<h4>44</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Yet now hear, O Jacob, My servant and Israel, whom I have chosen.

<p><sup>2</sup> Thus says the Lord, Who made you and formed you from the womb, Who will help you: Fear not, O Jacob, My servant, and you Jeshurun <font color='#7a8080'>[the upright one—applied to Israel as a type of the Messiah]</font>, whom I have chosen.

<p><sup>3</sup> For I will pour water upon him who is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground. I will pour My Spirit upon your offspring, and My blessing upon your descendants.

<p><sup>4</sup> And they shall spring up among the grass like willows <i>or</i> poplars by the watercourses.

<p><sup>5</sup> One will say, I am the Lord's; and another will call himself by the name of Jacob; and another will write <font color='#7a8080'>[even brand or tattoo]</font> upon his hand, I am the Lord's, and surname himself by the <font color='#7a8080'>[honorable]</font> name of Israel.

<p><sup>6</sup> Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: I am the First and I am the Last; besides Me there is no God.

<p><sup>7</sup> Who is like Me? Let him <font color='#7a8080'>[stand and]</font> proclaim it, declare it, and set <font color='#7a8080'>[his proofs]</font> in order before Me, since I made <i>and</i> established the people of antiquity. <font color='#7a8080'>[Who has announced from of old]</font> the things that are coming? Then let them declare yet future things.

<p><sup>8</sup> Fear not, nor be afraid <font color='#7a8080'>[in the coming violent upheavals]</font>; have I not told it to you from of old and declared it? And you are My witnesses! Is there a God besides Me? There is no <font color='#7a8080'>[other]</font> Rock; I know not any.

<p><sup>9</sup> All who make graven idols are confusion, chaos, <i>and</i> worthlessness. Their objects (idols) in which they delight do not profit them, and their own witnesses (worshipers) do not see or know, so that they are put to shame.

<p><sup>10</sup> Who is <font color='#7a8080'>[such a fool as]</font> to fashion a god or cast a graven image that is profitable for nothing?

<p><sup>11</sup> Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame, and the craftsmen, <font color='#7a8080'>[how can they make a god?]</font> they are but men. Let them all be gathered together, let them stand forth; they shall be terrified, they shall be put to shame together.

<p><sup>12</sup> The ironsmith sharpens <i>and</i> uses a chisel and works it over the coals; he shapes <font color='#7a8080'>[the core of the idol]</font> with hammers and forges it with his strong arm. He becomes hungry and his strength fails; he drinks no water and is faint.

<p><sup>13</sup> The carpenter stretches out a line, he marks it out with a pencil <i>or</i> red ocher; he fashions <font color='#7a8080'>[an idol]</font> with planes and marks it out with the compasses; and he shapes it to have the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, that it may dwell in a house.

<p><sup>14</sup> He hews for himself cedars, and takes the holm tree and the oak and lets them grow strong for himself among the trees of the forest; he plants a fir tree <i>or</i> an ash, and the rain nourishes it.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then it becomes fuel for a man to burn; a part of it he takes and warms himself, yes, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. <font color='#7a8080'>[Then out of the remainder, the leavings]</font> he also makes a god and worships it! He <font color='#7a8080'>[with his own hands]</font> makes it into a graven image and falls down and worships it!

<p><sup>16</sup> He burns part of the wood in the fire; with part of it he <font color='#7a8080'>[cooks and]</font> eats flesh, he roasts meat and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire!

<p><sup>17</sup> And from what is left <font color='#7a8080'>[of the log]</font> he makes a god, his graven idol. He falls down to it, he worships it and prays to it and says, Deliver me, for you are my god!

<p><sup>18</sup> They do not know or understand, for their eyes God has let become besmeared so that they cannot see, <i>and</i> their minds as well so that they cannot understand.

<p><sup>19</sup> And no one considers in his mind, nor has he knowledge and understanding <font color='#7a8080'>[enough]</font> to say <font color='#7a8080'>[to himself]</font>, I have burned part of this log in the fire, and also I have baked bread on its coals and have roasted meat and eaten it. And shall I make the remainder of it into an abomination <font color='#7a8080'>[the very essence of what is disgusting, detestable, and shamefully vile in the eyes of a jealous God]</font>? Shall I fall down <i>and</i> worship the stock of a tree <font color='#7a8080'>[a block of wood without consciousness or life]</font>?

<p><sup>20</sup> That kind of man feeds on ashes <font color='#7a8080'>[and finds his satisfaction in ashes]</font>! A deluded mind has led him astray, so that he cannot release <i>and</i> save himself, or ask, Is not <font color='#7a8080'>[this thing I am holding]</font> in my right hand a lie?

<p><sup>21</sup> Remember these things <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font>, O Jacob, O Israel, for you are My servant! I formed you, you are My servant; O Israel, you shall not be forgotten by Me.

<p><sup>22</sup> I have blotted out like a thick cloud your transgressions, and like a cloud your sins. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.

<p><sup>23</sup> Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done it; shout, you depths of the earth; break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest and every tree in it! For the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and He glorifies Himself in Israel.

<p><sup>24</sup> Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, and He Who formed you from the womb: I am the Lord, Who made all things, Who alone stretched out the heavens, Who spread out the earth by Myself <font color='#7a8080'>[who was with Me]</font>?—

<p><sup>25</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[I am the Lord]</font> Who frustrates the signs <i>and</i> confounds the omens <font color='#7a8080'>[upon which the false prophets' forecasts of the future are based]</font> of the <font color='#7a8080'>[boasting]</font> liars and makes fools of diviners, Who turns the wise backward and makes their knowledge foolishness,

<p><sup>26</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Lord]</font> Who confirms the word of His servant and performs the counsel of His messengers, Who says of Jerusalem, She shall <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font> be inhabited, and of the cities of Judah, They shall <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font> be built, and I will raise up their ruins,

<p><sup>27</sup> Who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers,

<p><sup>28</sup> Who says of Cyrus, He is My shepherd (ruler), and he shall perform all My pleasure <i>and</i> fulfill all My purpose—even saying of Jerusalem, She shall <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font> be built, and of the temple, Your foundation shall <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font> be laid.

<h4>45</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held to subdue nations before him, and I will unarm <i>and</i> ungird the loins of kings to open doors before him, so that gates will not be shut.

<p><sup>2</sup> I will go before you and level the mountains <font color='#7a8080'>[to make the crooked places straight]</font>; I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut asunder the bars of iron.

<p><sup>3</sup> And I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, Who calls you by your name.

<p><sup>4</sup> For the sake of Jacob My servant, and of Israel My chosen, I have called you by your name. I have surnamed you, though you have not known Me.

<p><sup>5</sup> I am the Lord, and there is no one else; there is no God besides Me. I will gird <i>and</i> arm you, though you have not known Me,

<p><sup>6</sup> That men may know from the east <i>and</i> the rising of the sun and from the west <i>and</i> the setting of the sun that there is no God besides Me. I am the Lord, and no one else <font color='#7a8080'>[is He]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> I form the light and create darkness, I make peace <font color='#7a8080'>[national well-being]</font> and I create <font color='#7a8080'>[physical]</font> evil (calamity); I am the Lord, Who does all these things.

<p><sup>8</sup> Let fall in showers, you heavens, from above, and let the skies rain down righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[the pure, spiritual, heaven-born possibilities that have their foundation in the holy being of God]</font>; let the earth open, and let them <font color='#7a8080'>[skies and earth]</font> sprout forth salvation, and let righteousness germinate <i>and</i> spring up <font color='#7a8080'>[as plants do]</font> together; I the Lord have created it.

<p><sup>9</sup> Woe to him who strives with his Maker!—a worthless piece of broken pottery among other pieces equally worthless <font color='#7a8080'>[and yet presuming to strive with his Maker]</font>! Shall the clay say to him who fashions it, What do you think you are making? or, Your work has no handles?

<p><sup>10</sup> Woe to him <font color='#7a8080'>[who complains against his parents that they have begotten him]</font> who says to a father, What are you begetting? or to a woman, With what are you in travail?

<p><sup>11</sup> Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Would you question Me about things to come concerning My children, and concerning the work of My hands <font color='#7a8080'>[would you]</font> command Me?

<p><sup>12</sup> I made the earth and created man upon it. I, with My hands, stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.

<p><sup>13</sup> I will raise <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus]</font> up in righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[willing in every way that which is right and proper]</font>, and I will direct all his ways; he will build My city, and he will let My captives go, not for hire or for a bribe, says the Lord of hosts.

<p><sup>14</sup> Thus says the Lord: The labor <i>and</i> wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you and they shall be yours; they shall follow you; in chains <font color='#7a8080'>[of subjection to you]</font> they shall come over, and they shall fall down before you; they shall make supplication to you, saying, Surely God is with you, and there is no other, no God besides Him.

<p><sup>15</sup> Truly You are a God Who hides Himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

<p><sup>16</sup> They shall be put to shame, yes, confounded, all of them; they who are makers of idols shall go off into confusion together.

<p><sup>17</sup> But Israel shall be saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity.

<p><sup>18</sup> For thus says the Lord—Who created the heavens, God Himself, Who formed the earth and made it, Who established it and did not create it to be a worthless waste; He formed it to be inhabited—I am the Lord, and there is no one else.

<p><sup>19</sup> I have not spoken in secret, in a corner of the land of darkness; I did not call the descendants of Jacob <font color='#7a8080'>[to a fruitless service]</font>, saying, Seek Me for nothing <font color='#7a8080'>[but I promised them a just reward]</font>. I, the Lord, speak righteousness (the truth—trustworthy, straightforward correspondence between deeds and words); I declare things that are right.

<p><sup>20</sup> Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you survivors of the nations! They have no knowledge who carry about <font color='#7a8080'>[in religious processions or into battle]</font> their wooden idols and keep on praying to a god that cannot save.

<p><sup>21</sup> Declare and bring forward your strong arguments <font color='#7a8080'>[for praying to gods that cannot save]</font>; yes, take counsel together. Who announced this <font color='#7a8080'>[the rise of Cyrus and his conquests]</font> beforehand (long ago)? <font color='#7a8080'>[What god]</font> declared it of old? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no other God besides Me, a rigidly <i>and</i> uncompromisingly just <i>and</i> righteous God and Savior; there is none besides Me.

<p><sup>22</sup> Look to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.

<p><sup>23</sup> I have sworn by Myself, the word is gone out of My mouth in righteousness and shall not return, that unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear <font color='#7a8080'>[allegiance]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> Only in the Lord shall one say, I have righteousness (salvation and victory) and strength <font color='#7a8080'>[to achieve]</font>. To Him shall all come who were incensed against Him, and they shall be ashamed.

<p><sup>25</sup> In the Lord shall all the offspring of Israel be justified (enjoy righteousness, salvation, and victory) and shall glory.

<h4>46</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Bel bows down, Nebo stoops <font color='#7a8080'>[gods of Babylon, whose idols are being carried off]</font>; their idols are on the beasts <font color='#7a8080'>[of burden]</font> and on the cattle. These things that you carry about are loaded as burdens on the weary beasts.

<p><sup>2</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The gods]</font> stoop, they bow down together; they cannot save <font color='#7a8080'>[their own idols]</font>, but are themselves going into captivity.

<p><sup>3</sup> Listen to Me <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font>, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, you who have been borne by Me from your birth, carried from the womb:

<p><sup>4</sup> Even to your old age I am He, and even to hair white with age will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry and will save you.

<p><sup>5</sup> To whom will you liken Me and make Me equal and compare Me, that we may be alike?

<p><sup>6</sup> They lavish gold out of the cup <i>or</i> bag, weigh out silver on the scales, and hire a goldsmith, and he fashions it into a god; <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> they fall down, yes, they worship it!

<p><sup>7</sup> They bear it upon their shoulders <font color='#7a8080'>[in religious processions or into battle]</font>; they carry it and set it down in its place, and there it stands. It cannot move from its place. Even if one cries to it for help, yet <font color='#7a8080'>[the idol]</font> cannot answer or save him out of his distress.

<p><sup>8</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Earnestly]</font> remember this, be ashamed <i>and</i> own yourselves guilty; bring it again to mind <i>and</i> lay it to heart, O you rebels!

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Earnestly]</font> remember the former things, <font color='#7a8080'>[which I did]</font> of old; for I am God, and there is no one else; I am God, and there is none like Me,

<p><sup>10</sup> Declaring the end <i>and</i> the result from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure <i>and</i> purpose,

<p><sup>11</sup> Calling a ravenous bird from the east—the man <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus]</font> who executes My counsel from a far country. Yes, I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed it, and I will do it.

<p><sup>12</sup> Listen to Me, you stiff-hearted <i>and</i> you who have lost heart, you who are far from righteousness (from uprightness and right standing with God, and from His righteous deliverance).

<p><sup>13</sup> I bring near My righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[in the deliverance of Israel]</font>, it will not be far off; and My salvation shall not tarry. And I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel My glory <font color='#7a8080'>[yes, give salvation in Zion and My glory to Israel]</font>.

<h4>47</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Come down, and sit in the dust, O Virgin Daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground <font color='#7a8080'>[in abject humiliation]</font>; there is no throne for you, O Daughter of the Chaldeans, for you shall no longer be called dainty and delicate.

<p><sup>2</sup> Take the millstones <font color='#7a8080'>[like the poorest female slave of the household does]</font> and grind meal; take off your veil <i>and</i> uncover your hair. Remove your skirt, bare your leg, wade through the rivers <font color='#7a8080'>[at the command of your captors]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Your nakedness shall be exposed, and your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will spare no man <font color='#7a8080'>[none I encounter will be able to resist Me]</font>,

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Says]</font> our Redeemer—the Lord of hosts is His name—the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>5</sup> Sit in silence and go into darkness, O Daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the lady <i>and</i> mistress of kingdoms.

<p><sup>6</sup> I was angry with My people, I profaned My inheritance <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font>; and I gave them into your hand <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font>. You showed them no mercy; upon the old people you made your yoke very heavy.

<p><sup>7</sup> And you said, I shall be the mistress forever! So you did not lay these things to heart, nor did you <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember the certain, ultimate end of such conduct.

<p><sup>8</sup> Therefore now, hear this, you who love pleasures <i>and</i> are given over to them, you who dwell safely <i>and</i> sit securely, who say in your mind, I am <font color='#7a8080'>[the mistress]</font> and there is no one else besides me. I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children.

<p><sup>9</sup> But these two things shall come to you in a moment, in one day: loss of children and widowhood. They shall come upon you in full measure, in spite of the multitude of <font color='#7a8080'>[your claims to]</font> power given you by the assistance of evil spirits, in spite of the great abundance of your enchantments.

<p><sup>10</sup> For you <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font> have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart <i>and</i> mind, I am, and there is no one besides me.

<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore shall evil come upon you; you shall not know the dawning of it <i>or</i> how to charm it away. And a disaster <i>and</i> evil shall fall upon you that you shall not be able to atone for <font color='#7a8080'>[with all your offerings to your gods]</font>; and desolation shall come upon you suddenly, about which you shall know nothing <i>or</i> how to avert it.

<p><sup>12</sup> Persist, then, with your enchantments and the multitude of your sorceries <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font>, in which you have labored from your youth; and see if perhaps you will be able to profit, if you will prevail <i>and</i> strike terror!

<p><sup>13</sup> You are wearied with your many counsels <i>and</i> plans. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, and the monthly prognosticators stand up and make known to you <i>and</i> save you from the things that shall come upon you <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> Behold, they are like stubble; the fire consumes them. They cannot even deliver themselves from the power of the flame <font color='#7a8080'>[much less deliver the nation]</font>. There is no coal for warming <i>or</i> fire before which to sit!

<p><sup>15</sup> Such to you shall they <font color='#7a8080'>[the astrologers and their kind]</font> be, those with whom you have labored <i>and</i> such their fate, those who have done business with you from your youth; they will wander, every one to his own quarter <i>and</i> in his own direction. No one will save you.

<h4>48</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel and who come forth from the seed of Judah, you who swear allegiance by the name of the Lord and make mention of the God of Israel—but not in truth <i>and</i> sincerity, nor in righteousness (rightness and moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation)—

<p><sup>2</sup> For they call themselves <font color='#7a8080'>[citizens]</font> of the holy city and depend on the God of Israel—the Lord of hosts is His name.

<p><sup>3</sup> I have declared from the beginning the former things <font color='#7a8080'>[which happened in times past to Israel]</font>; they went forth from My mouth and I made them known; then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> Because I knew that you were obstinate, and your neck was an iron sinew and your brow was brass,

<p><sup>5</sup> Therefore I have declared things to come to you from of old; before they came to pass I announced them to you, so that you could not say, My idol has done them, and my graven image and my molten image have commanded them.

<p><sup>6</sup> You have heard <font color='#7a8080'>[these things foretold]</font>, now you see this fulfillment. And will you not bear witness to it? I show you specified new things from this time forth, even hidden things <font color='#7a8080'>[kept in reserve]</font> which you have not known.

<p><sup>7</sup> They are created now <font color='#7a8080'>[called into being by the prophetic word]</font>, and not long ago; and before today you have never heard of them, lest you should say, Behold, I knew them!

<p><sup>8</sup> Yes, you have never heard, yes, you have never known; yes, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I, the Lord, knew that you, O house of Israel, dealt very treacherously; you were called a transgressor <i>and</i> a rebel <font color='#7a8080'>[in revolt]</font> from your birth.

<p><sup>9</sup> For My name's sake I defer My anger, and for the sake of My praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.

<p><sup>10</sup> Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried <i>and</i> chosen you in the furnace of affliction.

<p><sup>11</sup> For My own sake, for My own sake, I do it <font color='#7a8080'>[I refrain and do not utterly destroy you]</font>; for why should I permit My name to be polluted <i>and</i> profaned <font color='#7a8080'>[which it would be if the Lord completely destroyed His chosen people]</font>? And I will not give My glory to another <font color='#7a8080'>[by permitting the worshipers of idols to triumph over you]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> Listen to Me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called <font color='#7a8080'>[ones]</font>: I am He; I am the First, I also am the Last.

<p><sup>13</sup> Yes, My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together <font color='#7a8080'>[to execute My decrees]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear! Who among them <font color='#7a8080'>[the gods and Chaldean astrologers]</font> has foretold these things? The Lord has loved him <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus of Persia]</font>; he will do His pleasure <i>and</i> purpose on Babylon, and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.

<p><sup>15</sup> I, even I, have foretold it; yes, I have called him <font color='#7a8080'>[Cyrus]</font>; I have brought him, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> shall make his way prosperous.

<p><sup>16</sup> Come near to me and listen to this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it happened, I was there. And now the Lord God has sent His Spirit in <i>and</i> with me.

<p><sup>17</sup> Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord your God, Who teaches you to profit, Who leads you in the way that you should go.

<p><sup>18</sup> Oh, that you had hearkened to My commandments! Then your peace <i>and</i> prosperity would have been like a flowing river, and your righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[the holiness and purity of the nation]</font> like the <font color='#7a8080'>[abundant]</font> waves of the sea.

<p><sup>19</sup> Your offspring would have been like the sand, and your descendants like the offspring of the sea; their name would not be cut off or destroyed from before Me.

<p><sup>20</sup> Go forth out of Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans! With a voice of singing declare, tell this, cause it to go forth even to the end of the earth; say, The Lord has redeemed His servant Jacob!

<p><sup>21</sup> And they thirsted not when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

<p><sup>22</sup> There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked.

<h4>49</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Listen to me, O isles <i>and</i> coastlands, and hearken, you peoples from afar. The Lord has called me from the womb; from the body of my mother He has named my name.

<p><sup>2</sup> And He has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand has He hid me and made me a polished arrow; in His quiver has He kept me close <i>and</i> concealed me.

<p><sup>3</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> said to me, You are My servant, Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[you who strive with God and with men and prevail]</font>, in whom I will be glorified.

<p><sup>4</sup> Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and in empty futility; yet surely my right is with the Lord, and my recompense is with my God.

<p><sup>5</sup> And now, says the Lord—Who formed me from the womb to be His servant to bring Jacob back to Him and that Israel might be gathered to Him <i>and</i> not be swept away, for I am honorable in the eyes of the Lord and my God has become my strength—

<p><sup>6</sup> He says, It is too light a thing that you should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors <font color='#7a8080'>[of the judgments]</font> of Israel; I will also give you for a light to the nations, that My salvation may extend to the end of the earth.

<p><sup>7</sup> Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, Israel's Holy One, to him whom man rejects <i>and</i> despises, to him whom the nations abhor, to the servant of rulers: Kings shall see you and arise; princes, and they shall prostrate themselves, because of the Lord, Who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, Who has chosen you.

<p><sup>8</sup> Thus says the Lord, In an acceptable <i>and</i> favorable time I have heard <i>and</i> answered you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you; and I will preserve you and give you for a covenant to the people, to raise up <i>and</i> establish the land <font color='#7a8080'>[from its present state of ruin]</font> and to apportion <i>and</i> cause them to inherit the desolate <font color='#7a8080'>[moral wastes of heathenism, their]</font> heritages,

<p><sup>9</sup> Saying to those who are bound, Come forth, and to those who are in <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> darkness, Show yourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[come into the light of the Sun of righteousness]</font>. They shall feed in all the ways <font color='#7a8080'>[in which they go]</font>, and their pastures shall be <font color='#7a8080'>[not in deserts, but]</font> on all the bare <font color='#7a8080'>[grass-covered]</font> hills.

<p><sup>10</sup> They will not hunger or thirst, neither will mirage <font color='#7a8080'>[mislead]</font> or scorching wind or sun smite them; for He Who has mercy on them will lead them, and by springs of water will He guide them.

<p><sup>11</sup> And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways will be raised up.

<p><sup>12</sup> Behold, these shall come from afar—and, behold, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Sinim (China).

<p><sup>13</sup> Sing for joy, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into singing, O mountains! For the Lord has comforted His people and will have compassion upon His afflicted.

<p><sup>14</sup> But Zion <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem, her people as seen in captivity]</font> said, The Lord has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.

<p><sup>15</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[And the Lord answered]</font> Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget, yet I will not forget you.

<p><sup>16</sup> Behold, I have indelibly imprinted (tattooed a picture of) you on the palm of each of My hands; <font color='#7a8080'>[O Zion]</font> your walls are continually before Me.

<p><sup>17</sup> Your children <i>and</i> your builders make haste; your destroyers and those who laid you waste go forth from you.

<p><sup>18</sup> Lift up your eyes round about and see <font color='#7a8080'>[the returning exiles, ready to rebuild Jerusalem]</font>; all these gather together and come to you. As I live, says the Lord, you <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font> shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament and bind them on you as a bride does.

<p><sup>19</sup> For your waste and desolate places and your land <font color='#7a8080'>[once the scene]</font> of destruction surely now <font color='#7a8080'>[in coming years]</font> will be too narrow to accommodate the population, and those who once swallowed you up will be far away.

<p><sup>20</sup> The children of your bereavement <font color='#7a8080'>[born during your captivity]</font> shall yet say in your ears, The place is too narrow for me; make room for me, that I may live.

<p><sup>21</sup> Then <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font>, you will say in your heart, Who has borne me all these children, seeing that I lost my offspring and am alone <i>and</i> barren <i>and</i> unfruitful, an exile put away and wandering hither and thither? And who brought them up? Behold, I was left alone <font color='#7a8080'>[put away by the Lord, my Husband]</font>; from where then did all these children come?

<p><sup>22</sup> Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up My hand to the Gentile nations and set up My standard <i>and</i> raise high My signal banner to the peoples; and they will bring your sons in the bosom of their garments, and your daughters will be carried upon their shoulders.

<p><sup>23</sup> And kings shall be your foster fathers <i>and</i> guardians, and their queens your nursing mothers. They shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know <font color='#7a8080'>[with an acquaintance and understanding based on and grounded in personal experience]</font> that I am the Lord; for they shall not be put to shame who wait for, look for, hope for, <i>and</i> expect Me.

<p><sup>24</sup> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives of the just be delivered?

<p><sup>25</sup> For thus says the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty will be taken away, and the prey of the terrible will be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will give safety to your children <i>and</i> ease them.

<p><sup>26</sup> And I will make those who oppress you consume themselves <font color='#7a8080'>[in mutually destructive wars]</font>, thus eating their own flesh; and they will be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh will know <font color='#7a8080'>[with a knowledge grounded in personal experience]</font> that I, the Lord, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

<h4>50</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother's divorce with which I put her away, O Israel? Or which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.

<p><sup>2</sup> Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink because there is no water, and they die of thirst.

<p><sup>3</sup> I clothe the heavens with <font color='#7a8080'>[the]</font> blackness <font color='#7a8080'>[of murky storm clouds]</font>, and I make sackcloth <font color='#7a8080'>[of mourning]</font> their covering.

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Servant of God says]</font> The Lord God has given Me the tongue of a disciple <i>and</i> of one who is taught, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary. He wakens Me morning by morning, He wakens My ear to hear as a disciple <font color='#7a8080'>[as one who is taught]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> The Lord God has opened My ear, and I have not been rebellious or turned backward.

<p><sup>6</sup> I gave My back to the smiters and My cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I hid not My face from shame and spitting.

<p><sup>7</sup> For the Lord God helps Me; therefore have I not been ashamed <i>or</i> confounded. Therefore have I set My face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.

<p><sup>8</sup> He is near Who declares Me in the right. Who will contend with Me? Let us stand forth together! Who is My adversary? Let him come near to Me.

<p><sup>9</sup> Behold, the Lord God will help Me; who is he who will condemn Me? Behold, they all will wax old <i>and</i> be worn out as a garment; the moth will eat them up.

<p><sup>10</sup> Who is among you who <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fears the Lord, who obeys the voice of His Servant, yet who walks in darkness <i>and</i> deep trouble and has no shining splendor <font color='#7a8080'>[in his heart]</font>? Let him rely on, trust in, <i>and</i> be confident in the name of the Lord, and let him lean upon <i>and</i> be supported by his God.

<p><sup>11</sup> Behold, all you <font color='#7a8080'>[enemies of your own selves]</font> who attempt to kindle your own fires <font color='#7a8080'>[and work out your own plans of salvation]</font>, who surround <i>and</i> gird yourselves with momentary sparks, darts, <i>and</i> firebrands that you set aflame!—walk by the light of your self-made fire and of the sparks that you have kindled <font color='#7a8080'>[for yourself, if you will]</font>! But this shall you have from My hand: you shall lie down in grief <i>and</i> in torment.

<h4>51</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Hearken to Me, you who follow after rightness <i>and</i> justice, you who seek <i>and</i> inquire of <font color='#7a8080'>[and require]</font> the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[claiming Him by necessity and by right]</font>: look to the rock from which you were hewn and to the hole in the quarry from which you were dug;

<p><sup>2</sup> Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you; for I called him when he was but one, and I blessed him and made him many.

<p><sup>3</sup> For the Lord will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places. And He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song <i>or</i> instrument of praise.

<p><sup>4</sup> Listen to Me <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font>, O My people, and give ear to Me, O My nation; for a <font color='#7a8080'>[divine]</font> law will go forth from Me, and I will establish My justice for a light to the peoples.

<p><sup>5</sup> My rightness <i>and</i> justice are near, My salvation is going forth, and My arms shall rule the peoples; the islands shall wait for <i>and</i> expect Me, and on My arm shall they trust <i>and</i> wait with hope.

<p><sup>6</sup> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall be dissolved <i>and</i> vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner <font color='#7a8080'>[like gnats]</font>. But My salvation shall be forever, and My rightness <i>and</i> justice <font color='#7a8080'>[and faithfully fulfilled promise]</font> shall not be abolished.

<p><sup>7</sup> Listen to Me, you who know rightness <i>and</i> justice <i>and</i> right standing with God, the people in whose heart is My law <i>and</i> My instruction: fear not the reproach of men, neither be afraid <i>nor</i> dismayed at their revilings.

<p><sup>8</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[in comparison with the Lord they are so weak that things as insignificant as]</font> the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But My rightness <i>and</i> justice <font color='#7a8080'>[and faithfully fulfilled promise]</font> shall be forever, and My salvation to all generations.

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion now cries to the Lord, the God of Israel]</font> Awake, awake, put on strength <i>and</i> might, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, as in the generations of long ago. Was it not You Who cut Rahab <font color='#7a8080'>[Egypt]</font> in pieces, Who pierced the dragon <font color='#7a8080'>[symbol of Egypt]</font>?

<p><sup>10</sup> Was it not You Who dried up the Red Sea, the waters of the great deep, Who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over? <font color='#7a8080'>[Why then are we left so long in captivity?]</font>

<p><sup>11</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Lord God says]</font> And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing to Zion; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

<p><sup>12</sup> I, even I, am He Who comforts you. Who are you, that you should be afraid of man, who shall die, and of a son of man, who shall be made <font color='#7a8080'>[as destructible]</font> as grass,

<p><sup>13</sup> That you should forget the Lord your Maker, Who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, and fear continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy <i>or</i> even though he did so? And where is the fury of the oppressor?

<p><sup>14</sup> The captive exile <i>and</i> he who is bent down by chains shall speedily be released; and he shall not die and go down to the pit of destruction, nor shall his food fail.

<p><sup>15</sup> For I am the Lord your God, Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar <i>and</i> Who by rebuke restrains it—the Lord of hosts is His name.

<p><sup>16</sup> And I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, that I may fix the <font color='#7a8080'>[new]</font> heavens as a tabernacle and lay the foundations of a <font color='#7a8080'>[new]</font> earth and say to Zion, You are My people.

<p><sup>17</sup> Arouse yourself, awake! Stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of His wrath, you who have drunk the cup of staggering <i>and</i> intoxication to the dregs.

<p><sup>18</sup> There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne; neither is there anyone to take her by the hand among all the sons whom she has brought up.

<p><sup>19</sup> Two kinds of calamities have befallen you—but who feels sorry for <i>and</i> commiserates you?—they are desolation and destruction <font color='#7a8080'>[on the land and city]</font>, and famine and sword <font color='#7a8080'>[on the inhabitants]</font>—how shall I comfort you <i>or</i> by whom?

<p><sup>20</sup> Your sons have fainted; they lie <font color='#7a8080'>[like corpses]</font> at the head of all the streets, like an antelope in a net; they are full <font color='#7a8080'>[from drinking]</font> of the wrath of the Lord, the rebuke of your God.

<p><sup>21</sup> Therefore, now hear this, you who are afflicted, and <font color='#7a8080'>[who are]</font> drunk, but not with wine <font color='#7a8080'>[but thrown down by the wrath of God]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> Thus says your Lord, the Lord, and your God, Who pleads the cause of His people: Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering <i>and</i> intoxication; the cup of My wrath you shall drink no more.

<p><sup>23</sup> And I will put it into the hands of your tormentors <i>and</i> oppressors, those who said to you, Bow down, that we may ride <i>or</i> tread over you; and you have made your back like the ground and like the street for them to pass over.

<h4>52</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.

<p><sup>2</sup> Shake yourself from the dust; arise, sit <font color='#7a8080'>[erect in a dignified place]</font>, O Jerusalem; loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion.

<p><sup>3</sup> For thus says the Lord: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money.

<p><sup>4</sup> For thus says the Lord God: My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there; and <font color='#7a8080'>[many years later Sennacherib]</font> the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing. <font color='#7a8080'>[Now I delivered you from both Egypt and Assyria; what then can prevent Me from delivering you from Babylon?]</font>

<p><sup>5</sup> But now what have I here, says the Lord, seeing that My people have been taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them howl <font color='#7a8080'>[with joy]</font>, says the Lord, and My name continually is blasphemed all day long.

<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore My people shall know what My name is <i>and</i> what it means; therefore they shall know in that day that I am He who speaks; behold, <b>I Am</b>!

<p><sup>7</sup> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good tidings, who publishes peace, who brings good tidings of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns!

<p><sup>8</sup> Hark, your watchmen lift up their voices; together they sing for joy; for they shall see eye to eye the return of the Lord to Zion.

<p><sup>9</sup> Break forth joyously, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem!

<p><sup>10</sup> The Lord has made bare His holy arm before the eyes of all the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[revealing Himself as the One by Whose direction the redemption of Israel from captivity is accomplished]</font>, and all the ends of the earth shall witness the salvation of our God.

<p><sup>11</sup> Depart, depart, go out from there <font color='#7a8080'>[the lands of exile]</font>! Touch no unclean thing! Go out of the midst of her <font color='#7a8080'>[Babylon]</font>; cleanse yourselves <i>and</i> be clean, you who bear the vessels of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[on your journey from there]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> For you will not go out with haste, nor will you go in flight <font color='#7a8080'>[as was necessary when Israel left Egypt]</font>; for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.

<p><sup>13</sup> Behold, My Servant shall deal wisely <i>and</i> shall prosper; He shall be exalted and extolled and shall stand very high.

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[For many the Servant of God became an object of horror; many were astonished at Him.]</font> His face <i>and</i> His whole appearance were marred more than any man's, and His form beyond that of the sons of men—but just as many were astonished at Him,

<p><sup>15</sup> So shall He startle <i>and</i> sprinkle many nations, and kings shall shut their mouths because of Him; for that which has not been told them shall they see, and that which they have not heard shall they consider <i>and</i> understand.

<h4>53</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Who has believed (trusted in, relied upon, and clung to) our message <font color='#7a8080'>[of that which was revealed to us]</font>? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been disclosed?

<p><sup>2</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[the Servant of God]</font> grew up before Him like a tender plant, and like a root out of dry ground; He has no form or comeliness <font color='#7a8080'>[royal, kingly pomp]</font>, that we should look at Him, and no beauty that we should desire Him.

<p><sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected <i>and</i> forsaken by men, a Man of sorrows <i>and</i> pains, and acquainted with grief <i>and</i> sickness; and like One from Whom men hide their faces He was despised, and we did not appreciate His worth <i>or</i> have any esteem for Him.

<p><sup>4</sup> Surely He has borne our griefs (sicknesses, weaknesses, and distresses) and carried our sorrows <i>and</i> pains <font color='#7a8080'>[of punishment]</font>, yet we <font color='#7a8080'>[ignorantly]</font> considered Him stricken, smitten, and afflicted by God <font color='#7a8080'>[as if with leprosy]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our guilt <i>and</i> iniquities; the chastisement <font color='#7a8080'>[needful to obtain]</font> peace <i>and</i> well-being for us was upon Him, and with the stripes <font color='#7a8080'>[that wounded]</font> Him we are healed <i>and</i> made whole.

<p><sup>6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has made to light upon Him the guilt <i>and</i> iniquity of us all.

<p><sup>7</sup> He was oppressed, <font color='#7a8080'>[yet when]</font> He was afflicted, He was submissive <i>and</i> opened not His mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.

<p><sup>8</sup> By oppression and judgment He was taken away; and as for His generation, who among them considered that He was cut off out of the land of the living <font color='#7a8080'>[stricken to His death]</font> for the transgression of my <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah's]</font> people, to whom the stroke was due?

<p><sup>9</sup> And they assigned Him a grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth.

<p><sup>10</sup> Yet it was the will of the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief <i>and</i> made Him sick. When You <i>and</i> He make His life an offering for sin <font color='#7a8080'>[and He has risen from the dead, in time to come]</font>, He shall see His <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> offspring, He shall prolong His days, and the will <i>and</i> pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.

<p><sup>11</sup> He shall see <font color='#7a8080'>[the fruit]</font> of the travail of His soul and be satisfied; by His knowledge of Himself <font color='#7a8080'>[which He possesses and imparts to others]</font> shall My <font color='#7a8080'>[uncompromisingly]</font> righteous One, My Servant, justify many <i>and</i> make many righteous (upright and in right standing with God), for He shall bear their iniquities <i>and</i> their guilt <font color='#7a8080'>[with the consequences, says the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great <font color='#7a8080'>[kings and rulers]</font>, and He shall divide the spoil with the mighty, because He poured out His life unto death, and <font color='#7a8080'>[He let Himself]</font> be regarded as a criminal <i>and</i> be numbered with the transgressors; yet He bore <font color='#7a8080'>[and took away]</font> the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors (the rebellious).

<h4>54</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Sing, O barren one, you who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child! For the <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> children of the desolate one will be more than the children of the married wife, says the Lord.

<p><sup>2</sup> Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; spare not; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes,

<p><sup>3</sup> For you will spread abroad to the right hand and to the left; and your offspring will possess the nations and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

<p><sup>4</sup> Fear not, for you shall not be ashamed; neither be confounded <i>and</i> depressed, for you shall not be put to shame. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and you shall not <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.

<p><sup>5</sup> For your Maker is your Husband—the Lord of hosts is His name—and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole earth He is called.

<p><sup>6</sup> For the Lord has called you like a woman forsaken, grieved in spirit, <i>and</i> heartsore—even a wife <font color='#7a8080'>[wooed and won]</font> in youth, when she is <font color='#7a8080'>[later]</font> refused <i>and</i> scorned, says your God.

<p><sup>7</sup> For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion <i>and</i> mercy I will gather you <font color='#7a8080'>[to Me]</font> again.

<p><sup>8</sup> In a little burst of wrath I hid My face from you for a moment, but with age-enduring love <i>and</i> kindness I will have compassion <i>and</i> mercy on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer.

<p><sup>9</sup> For this is like the days of Noah to Me; as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you.

<p><sup>10</sup> For though the mountains should depart and the hills be shaken <i>or</i> removed, yet My love <i>and</i> kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace <i>and</i> completeness be removed, says the Lord, Who has compassion on you.

<p><sup>11</sup> O you afflicted <font color='#7a8080'>[city]</font>, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in fair colors <font color='#7a8080'>[in antimony to enhance their brilliance]</font> and lay your foundations with sapphires.

<p><sup>12</sup> And I will make your windows <i>and</i> pinnacles of <font color='#7a8080'>[sparkling]</font> agates <i>or</i> rubies, and your gates of <font color='#7a8080'>[shining]</font> carbuncles, and all your walls <font color='#7a8080'>[of your enclosures]</font> of precious stones.

<p><sup>13</sup> And all your <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> children shall be disciples <font color='#7a8080'>[taught by the Lord and obedient to His will]</font>, and great shall be the peace <i>and</i> undisturbed composure of your children.

<p><sup>14</sup> You shall establish yourself in righteousness (rightness, in conformity with God's will and order): you shall be far from even the thought of oppression <i>or</i> destruction, for you shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near you.

<p><sup>15</sup> Behold, they may gather together <i>and</i> stir up strife, but it is not from Me. Whoever stirs up strife against you shall fall <i>and</i> surrender to you.

<p><sup>16</sup> Behold, I have created the smith who blows on the fire of coals and who produces a weapon for its purpose; and I have created the devastator to destroy.

<p><sup>17</sup> But no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong. This <font color='#7a8080'>[peace, righteousness, security, triumph over opposition]</font> is the heritage of the servants of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[those in whom the ideal Servant of the Lord is reproduced]</font>; this is the righteousness <i>or</i> the vindication which they obtain from Me <font color='#7a8080'>[this is that which I impart to them as their justification]</font>, says the Lord.

<h4>55</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Wait <i>and</i> listen, everyone who is thirsty! Come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Yes, come, buy <font color='#7a8080'>[priceless, spiritual]</font> wine and milk without money and without price <font color='#7a8080'>[simply for the self-surrender that accepts the blessing]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your earnings for what does not satisfy? Hearken diligently to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness <font color='#7a8080'>[the profuseness of spiritual joy]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Incline your ear <font color='#7a8080'>[submit and consent to the divine will]</font> and come to Me; hear, and your soul will revive; and I will make an everlasting covenant <i>or</i> league with you, even the sure mercy (kindness, goodwill, and compassion) promised to David.

<p><sup>4</sup> Behold, I have appointed him (Him) <font color='#7a8080'>[David, as a representative of the Messiah, or the Messiah Himself]</font> to be a witness <font color='#7a8080'>[one (One) who shall testify of salvation]</font> to the nations, a prince (Prince) and commander (Commander) to the peoples.

<p><sup>5</sup> Behold, you <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> shall call nations that you know not, and nations that do not know you shall run to you because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you.

<p><sup>6</sup> Seek, inquire for, <i>and</i> require the Lord while He may be found <font color='#7a8080'>[claiming Him by necessity and by right]</font>; call upon Him while He is near.

<p><sup>7</sup> Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and He will have love, pity, <i>and</i> mercy for him, and to our God, for He will multiply to him His abundant pardon.

<p><sup>8</sup> For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord.

<p><sup>9</sup> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.

<p><sup>10</sup> For as the rain and snow come down from the heavens, and return not there again, but water the earth and make it bring forth and sprout, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,

<p><sup>11</sup> So shall My word be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return to Me void <font color='#7a8080'>[without producing any effect, useless]</font>, but it shall accomplish that which I please <i>and</i> purpose, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.

<p><sup>12</sup> For you shall go out <font color='#7a8080'>[from the spiritual exile caused by sin and evil into the homeland]</font> with joy and be led forth <font color='#7a8080'>[by your Leader, the Lord Himself, and His word]</font> with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

<p><sup>13</sup> Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree; and it shall be to the Lord for a name of renown, for an everlasting sign <font color='#7a8080'>[of jubilant exaltation]</font> <i>and</i> memorial <font color='#7a8080'>[to His praise]</font>, which shall not be cut off.

<h4>56</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord: Keep justice, do <i>and</i> use righteousness (conformity to the will of God which brings salvation), for My salvation is soon to come and My righteousness (My rightness and justice) to be revealed.

<p><sup>2</sup> Blessed, happy, <i>and</i> fortunate is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold of it <i>and</i> binds himself fast to it, who keeps sacred the Sabbath so as not to profane it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.

<p><sup>3</sup> Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say, The Lord will surely separate me from His people. And let not the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

<p><sup>4</sup> For thus says the Lord: To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths and choose the things which please Me and hold firmly My covenant—

<p><sup>5</sup> To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial and a name better <font color='#7a8080'>[and more enduring]</font> than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.

<p><sup>6</sup> Also the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord to minister to Him and to love the name of the Lord and to be His servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it and who holds fast My covenant <font color='#7a8080'>[by conscientious obedience]</font>—

<p><sup>7</sup> All these I will bring to My holy mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on My altar; for My house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.

<p><sup>8</sup> Thus says the Lord God, Who gathers the outcasts of Israel: I will gather yet others to <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> besides those already gathered.

<p><sup>9</sup> All you beasts of the field, come to devour, all you beasts (hostile nations) in the forest.

<p><sup>10</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel's]</font> watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, they love to slumber.

<p><sup>11</sup> Yes, the dogs are greedy; they never have enough. And such are the shepherds who cannot understand; they have all turned to their own way, each one to his own gain, from every quarter <font color='#7a8080'>[one and all]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> Come, say they, We will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink! And tomorrow shall be as this day, a day great beyond measure.

<h4>57</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The righteous man perishes, and no one lays it to heart; and merciful <i>and</i> devout men are taken away, with no one considering that the uncompromisingly upright <i>and</i> godly person is taken away from the calamity <i>and</i> evil to come <font color='#7a8080'>[even through wickedness]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> He <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font> enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks straight <i>and</i> in his uprightness.

<p><sup>3</sup> But come close, you sons of a sorceress <font color='#7a8080'>[nursed in witchcraft and superstition]</font>, you offspring of an adulterer and a harlot.

<p><sup>4</sup> Against whom do you make sport <i>and</i> take your delight? Against whom do you open wide your mouth and put out your tongue? Are you not yourselves the children of transgression, the offspring of deceit—

<p><sup>5</sup> You who burn with lust <font color='#7a8080'>[inflaming yourselves with idols]</font> among the oaks, under every green tree, you who slay the children <font color='#7a8080'>[in sacrifice]</font> in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?

<p><sup>6</sup> Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they <font color='#7a8080'>[the idols]</font> are your lot; to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have offered a cereal offering. Should I be quiet in spite of all these things <font color='#7a8080'>[and leave them unpunished—bearing them with patience]</font>?

<p><sup>7</sup> Upon a lofty and high mountain you have openly <i>and</i> shamelessly set your <font color='#7a8080'>[idolatrous and adulterous]</font> bed; even there you went up to offer sacrifice <font color='#7a8080'>[in spiritual unfaithfulness to your divine Husband]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> Behind the door and the doorpost you have set up your <font color='#7a8080'>[idol]</font> symbol <font color='#7a8080'>[as a substitute for the Scripture text God ordered]</font>. Deserting Me, you have uncovered and ascended and enlarged your bed; and you have made a <font color='#7a8080'>[fresh]</font> bargain for yourself with <font color='#7a8080'>[the adulterers]</font>, and you loved their bed, where you saw <font color='#7a8080'>[a beckoning hand or a passion-inflaming image]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> And you went to the king <font color='#7a8080'>[of foreign lands with gifts]</font> <i>or</i> to Molech <font color='#7a8080'>[the god]</font> with oil and increased your perfumes <i>and</i> ointments; you sent your messengers far off and debased yourself even to Sheol (Hades) <font color='#7a8080'>[symbol of an abysmal depth of degradation]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> You were wearied with the length of your way <font color='#7a8080'>[in trying to find rest and satisfaction in alliances apart from the true God]</font>, yet you did not say, There is no result <i>or</i> profit. You found quickened strength; therefore you were not faint <i>or</i> heartsick <font color='#7a8080'>[or penitent]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> Of whom have you been so afraid and in dread that you lied <i>and</i> were treacherous and did not <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember Me, did not even give Me a thought? Have I not been silent, even for a long time, and so you do not fear Me?

<p><sup>12</sup> I will expose your <font color='#7a8080'>[pretended]</font> righteousness and your doings, but they will not help you.

<p><sup>13</sup> When you cry out, let your <font color='#7a8080'>[rabble]</font> collection of idols deliver you! But the wind shall take them all, a breath shall carry them away. But he who takes refuge in Me shall possess the land <font color='#7a8080'>[Judea]</font> and shall inherit My holy mountain <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion, also the heavenly inheritance and the spiritual Zion]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> And the word of One shall go forth, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way! Take up the stumbling block out of the way <font color='#7a8080'>[of the spiritual return]</font> of My people.

<p><sup>15</sup> For thus says the high and lofty One—He Who inhabits eternity, Whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, but with him also who is of a thoroughly penitent and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the thoroughly penitent <font color='#7a8080'>[bruised with sorrow for sin]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> For I will not contend forever, neither will I be angry always, for <font color='#7a8080'>[if I did stay angry]</font> the spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[of man]</font> would faint <i>and</i> be consumed before Me, and <font color='#7a8080'>[My purpose in]</font> creating the souls of men would be frustrated.

<p><sup>17</sup> Because of the iniquity of his <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah's]</font> covetousness <i>and</i> unjust gain I was angry and smote him. I hid my face and was angry, and he went on turning away <i>and</i> backsliding in the way of his <font color='#7a8080'>[own willful]</font> heart.

<p><sup>18</sup> I have seen his <font color='#7a8080'>[willful]</font> ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him also and will recompense him and restore comfort to him and to those who mourn for him.

<p><sup>19</sup> Peace, peace, to him who is far off <font color='#7a8080'>[both Jew and Gentile]</font> and to him who is near! says the Lord; I create the fruit of his lips, and I will heal him <font color='#7a8080'>[make his lips blossom anew with speech in thankful praise]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.

<p><sup>21</sup> There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.

<h4>58</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Cry aloud, spare not. Lift up your voice like a trumpet and declare to My people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins!

<p><sup>2</sup> Yet they seek, inquire for, <i>and</i> require Me daily and delight <font color='#7a8080'>[externally]</font> to know My ways, as <font color='#7a8080'>[if they were in reality]</font> a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God <font color='#7a8080'>[in visible ways]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Why have we fasted, they say, and You do not see it? Why have we afflicted ourselves, and You take no knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[of it]</font>? Behold <font color='#7a8080'>[O Israel]</font>, on the day of your fast <font color='#7a8080'>[when you should be grieving for your sins]</font>, you find profit in your business, and <font color='#7a8080'>[instead of stopping all work, as the law implies you and your workmen should do]</font> you extort from your hired servants a full amount of labor.

<p><sup>4</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The facts are that]</font> you fast only for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness. Fasting as you do today will not cause your voice to be heard on high.

<p><sup>5</sup> Is such a fast as yours what I have chosen, a day for a man to humble himself with sorrow in his soul? <font color='#7a8080'>[Is true fasting merely mechanical?]</font> Is it only to bow down his head like a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him <font color='#7a8080'>[to indicate a condition of heart that he does not have]</font>? Will you call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord?

<p><sup>6</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Rather]</font> is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every <font color='#7a8080'>[enslaving]</font> yoke?

<p><sup>7</sup> Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house—when you see the naked, that you cover him, and that you hide not yourself from <font color='#7a8080'>[the needs of]</font> your own flesh <i>and</i> blood?

<p><sup>8</sup> Then shall your light break forth like the morning, and your healing (your restoration and the power of a new life) shall spring forth speedily; your righteousness (your rightness, your justice, and your right relationship with God) shall go before you <font color='#7a8080'>[conducting you to peace and prosperity]</font>, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.

<p><sup>9</sup> Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and He will say, Here I am. If you take away from your midst yokes of oppression <font color='#7a8080'>[wherever you find them]</font>, the finger pointed in scorn <font color='#7a8080'>[toward the oppressed or the godly]</font>, and every form of false, harsh, unjust, <i>and</i> wicked speaking,

<p><sup>10</sup> And if you pour out that with which you sustain your own life for the hungry and satisfy the need of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in darkness, and your obscurity <i>and</i> gloom become like the noonday.

<p><sup>11</sup> And the Lord shall guide you continually and satisfy you in drought <i>and</i> in dry places and make strong your bones. And you shall be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not.

<p><sup>12</sup> And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of <font color='#7a8080'>[buildings that have laid waste for]</font> many generations; and you shall be called Repairer of the Breach, Restorer of Streets to Dwell In.

<p><sup>13</sup> If you turn away your foot from <font color='#7a8080'>[traveling unduly on]</font> the Sabbath, from doing your own pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> delight, the holy day of the Lord honorable, and honor Him <i>and</i> it, not going your own way or seeking <i>or</i> finding your own pleasure or speaking with your own <font color='#7a8080'>[idle]</font> words,

<p><sup>14</sup> Then will you delight yourself in the Lord, and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth, and I will feed you with the heritage <font color='#7a8080'>[promised for you]</font> of Jacob your father; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.

<h4>59</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened at all, that it cannot save, nor His ear dull with deafness, that it cannot hear.

<p><sup>2</sup> But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.

<p><sup>3</sup> For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.

<p><sup>4</sup> None sues <i>or</i> calls in righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[but for the sake of doing injury to others—to take some undue advantage]</font>; no one goes to law honestly <i>and</i> pleads <font color='#7a8080'>[his case]</font> in truth; they trust in emptiness, worthlessness <i>and</i> futility, and speaking lies! They conceive mischief and bring forth evil!

<p><sup>5</sup> They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; he who eats of their eggs dies, and <font color='#7a8080'>[from an egg]</font> which is crushed a viper breaks out <font color='#7a8080'>[for their nature is ruinous, deadly, evil]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> Their webs will not serve as clothing, nor will they cover themselves with what they make; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

<p><sup>7</sup> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths <i>and</i> highways.

<p><sup>8</sup> The way of peace they know not, and there is no justice <i>or</i> right in their goings. They have made them into crooked paths; whoever goes in them does not know peace.

<p><sup>9</sup> Therefore are justice <i>and</i> right far from us, and righteousness <i>and</i> salvation do not overtake us. We expectantly wait for light, but <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> see darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity <i>and</i> gloom.

<p><sup>10</sup> We grope for the wall like the blind, yes, we grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the twilight; in dark places <i>and</i> among those who are full of life <i>and</i> vigor, we are as dead men.

<p><sup>11</sup> We all groan <i>and</i> growl like bears and moan plaintively like doves. We look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.

<p><sup>12</sup> For our transgressions are multiplied before You <font color='#7a8080'>[O Lord]</font>, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know <i>and</i> recognize them <font color='#7a8080'>[as]</font>:

<p><sup>13</sup> Rebelling against and denying the Lord, turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving in and muttering <i>and</i> moaning from the heart words of falsehood.

<p><sup>14</sup> Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God) stands far off; for truth has fallen in the street (the city's forum), and uprightness cannot enter <font color='#7a8080'>[the courts of justice]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> Yes, truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And the Lord saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice.

<p><sup>16</sup> And He saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor <font color='#7a8080'>[no one to intervene on behalf of truth and right]</font>; therefore His own arm brought Him victory, and His own righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[having the Spirit without measure]</font> sustained Him.

<p><sup>17</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord]</font> put on righteousness as a breastplate <i>or</i> coat of mail, and salvation as a helmet upon His head; He put on garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal <font color='#7a8080'>[and furious divine jealousy]</font> as a cloak.

<p><sup>18</sup> According as their deeds deserve, so will He repay wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; on the foreign islands <i>and</i> coastlands He will make compensation.

<p><sup>19</sup> So <font color='#7a8080'>[as the result of the Messiah's intervention]</font> they shall <font color='#7a8080'>[reverently]</font> fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him <i>and</i> put him to flight <font color='#7a8080'>[for He will come like a rushing stream which the breath of the Lord drives]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> He shall come as a Redeemer to Zion and to those in Jacob (Israel) who turn from transgression, says the Lord.

<p><sup>21</sup> As for Me, this is My covenant <i>or</i> league with them, says the Lord: My Spirit, Who is upon you <font color='#7a8080'>[and Who writes the law of God inwardly on the heart]</font>, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouths of your <font color='#7a8080'>[true, spiritual]</font> children, or out of the mouths of your children's children, says the Lord, from henceforth and forever.

<h4>60</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Arise <font color='#7a8080'>[from the depression and prostration in which circumstances have kept you—rise to a new life]</font>! Shine (be radiant with the glory of the Lord), for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you!

<p><sup>2</sup> For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and dense darkness <font color='#7a8080'>[all]</font> peoples, but the Lord shall arise upon you <font color='#7a8080'>[O Jerusalem]</font>, and His glory shall be seen on you.

<p><sup>3</sup> And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.

<p><sup>4</sup> Lift up your eyes round about you and see! They all gather themselves together, they come to you. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried <i>and</i> nursed in the arms.

<p><sup>5</sup> Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill <i>and</i> tremble with joy <font color='#7a8080'>[at the glorious deliverance]</font> and be enlarged; because the abundant wealth of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Dead]</font> Sea shall be turned to you, unto you shall the nations come with their treasures.

<p><sup>6</sup> A multitude of camels <font color='#7a8080'>[from the eastern trading tribes]</font> shall cover you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font>, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all the men from Sheba <font color='#7a8080'>[who once came to trade]</font> shall come, bringing gold and frankincense and proclaiming the praises of the Lord.

<p><sup>7</sup> All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you <font color='#7a8080'>[as the eastern pastoral tribes join the trading tribes]</font>, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on My altar, and My glorious house I will glorify.

<p><sup>8</sup> Who are these who fly like a cloud, and like doves to their windows?

<p><sup>9</sup> Surely the isles <i>and</i> distant coastlands shall wait for <i>and</i> expect Me; and the ships of Tarshish <font color='#7a8080'>[shall come]</font> first, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and gold with them, for the name of the Lord your God, for the Holy One of Israel, because He has beautified <i>and</i> glorified you.

<p><sup>10</sup> Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you; for in My wrath I smote you, but in My favor, pleasure, <i>and</i> goodwill I have had mercy, love, <i>and</i> pity for you.

<p><sup>11</sup> And your gates shall be open continually, they shall not be shut day or night, that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations—and their kings led in procession <font color='#7a8080'>[your voluntary captives]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you in that day <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly laid waste.

<p><sup>13</sup> The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the plane, and the pine <font color='#7a8080'>[trees]</font> together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.

<p><sup>14</sup> The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending low to you, and all those who despised you shall bow down at your feet, and they shall call you the City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

<p><sup>15</sup> Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through you, I will make you <font color='#7a8080'>[Jerusalem]</font> an eternal glory, a joy from age to age.

<p><sup>16</sup> You shall suck the milk of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Gentile]</font> nations and shall suck the breast of kings; and you shall recognize <i>and</i> know that I, the Lord, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

<p><sup>17</sup> Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; and instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron. <font color='#7a8080'>[Instead of the tyranny of the present]</font> I will appoint peace as your officers and righteousness as your taskmasters.

<p><sup>18</sup> Violence shall no more be heard in your land, nor devastation or destruction within your borders, but you shall call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.

<p><sup>19</sup> The sun shall no more be your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to you, but the Lord shall be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory <i>and</i> your beauty.

<p><sup>20</sup> Your sun shall no more go down, nor shall your moon withdraw itself, for the Lord shall be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.

<p><sup>21</sup> Your people also shall all be <font color='#7a8080'>[uncompromisingly and consistently]</font> righteous; they shall possess the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, that I may be glorified.

<p><sup>22</sup> The least one shall become a thousand <font color='#7a8080'>[a clan]</font>, and the small one a strong nation. I, the Lord, will hasten it in its <font color='#7a8080'>[appointed]</font> time.

<h4>61</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed <i>and</i> qualified me to preach the Gospel <i>of</i> good tidings to the meek, the poor, <i>and</i> afflicted; He has sent me to bind up <i>and</i> heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the <font color='#7a8080'>[physical and spiritual]</font> captives and the opening of the prison <i>and</i> of the eyes to those who are bound,

<p><sup>2</sup> To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[the year of His favor]</font> and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,

<p><sup>3</sup> To grant <font color='#7a8080'>[consolation and joy]</font> to those who mourn in Zion—to give them an ornament (a garland or diadem) of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the garment <font color='#7a8080'>[expressive]</font> of praise instead of a heavy, burdened, <i>and</i> failing spirit—that they may be called oaks of righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[lofty, strong, and magnificent, distinguished for uprightness, justice, and right standing with God]</font>, the planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.

<p><sup>4</sup> And they shall rebuild the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former desolations and renew the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.

<p><sup>5</sup> Aliens shall stand <font color='#7a8080'>[ready]</font> and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

<p><sup>6</sup> But you shall be called the priests of the Lord; people will speak of you as the ministers of our God. You shall eat the wealth of the nations, and the glory <font color='#7a8080'>[once that of your captors]</font> shall be yours.

<p><sup>7</sup> Instead of your <font color='#7a8080'>[former]</font> shame you shall have a twofold recompense; instead of dishonor <i>and</i> reproach <font color='#7a8080'>[your people]</font> shall rejoice in their portion. Therefore in their land they shall possess double <font color='#7a8080'>[what they had forfeited]</font>; everlasting joy shall be theirs.

<p><sup>8</sup> For I the Lord love justice; I hate robbery <i>and</i> wrong with violence <i>or</i> a burnt offering. And I will faithfully give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant <i>or</i> league with them.

<p><sup>9</sup> And their offspring shall be known among the nations and their descendants among the peoples. All who see them <font color='#7a8080'>[in their prosperity]</font> will recognize <i>and</i> acknowledge that they are the people whom the Lord has blessed.

<p><sup>10</sup> I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul will exult in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

<p><sup>11</sup> For as <font color='#7a8080'>[surely as]</font> the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring forth, so <font color='#7a8080'>[surely]</font> the Lord God will cause rightness <i>and</i> justice and praise to spring forth before all the nations <font color='#7a8080'>[through the self-fulfilling power of His word]</font>.

<h4>62</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> For Zion's sake will I <font color='#7a8080'>[Isaiah]</font> not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until her imputed righteousness <i>and</i> vindication go forth as brightness, and her salvation radiates as does a burning torch.

<p><sup>2</sup> And the nations shall see your righteousness <i>and</i> vindication <font color='#7a8080'>[your rightness and justice—not your own, but His ascribed to you]</font>, and all kings shall behold your salvation and glory; and you shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name.

<p><sup>3</sup> You shall also be <font color='#7a8080'>[so beautiful and prosperous as to be thought of as]</font> a crown of glory <i>and</i> honor in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem <font color='#7a8080'>[exceedingly beautiful]</font> in the hand of your God.

<p><sup>4</sup> You <font color='#7a8080'>[Judah]</font> shall no more be termed Forsaken, nor shall your land be called Desolate any more. But you shall be called Hephzibah <font color='#7a8080'>[My delight is in her]</font>, and your land be called Beulah <font color='#7a8080'>[married]</font>; for the Lord delights in you, and your land shall be married <font color='#7a8080'>[owned and protected by the Lord]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> For as a young man marries a virgin <font color='#7a8080'>[O Jerusalem]</font>, so shall your sons marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.

<p><sup>6</sup> I have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem, who will never hold their peace day or night; you who <font color='#7a8080'>[are His servants and by your prayers]</font> put the Lord in remembrance <font color='#7a8080'>[of His promises]</font>, keep not silence,

<p><sup>7</sup> And give Him no rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her a praise in the earth.

<p><sup>8</sup> The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: Surely I will not again give your grain as food for your enemies, and <font color='#7a8080'>[the invading sons of]</font> aliens shall not drink your new wine for which you have toiled;

<p><sup>9</sup> But they who have gathered it shall eat it and praise the Lord, and they who have brought in the vintage shall drink it <font color='#7a8080'>[at the feasts celebrated]</font> in the courts of My sanctuary (the temple of My holiness).

<p><sup>10</sup> Go through, go through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Cast up, cast up the highway! Gather out the stones. Lift up a standard <i>or</i> ensign over <i>and</i> for the peoples.

<p><sup>11</sup> Behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the Daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes <font color='#7a8080'>[in the person of the Lord]</font>; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work <i>and</i> recompense before Him.

<p><sup>12</sup> And they shall call them the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you shall be called Sought Out, a City Not Forsaken.

<h4>63</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Who is this Who comes from Edom, with crimson-stained garments from Bozrah <font color='#7a8080'>[in Edom]</font>? This One Who is glorious in His apparel, striding triumphantly in the greatness of His might? It is I, <font color='#7a8080'>[the One]</font> Who speaks in righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[proclaiming vindication]</font>, mighty to save!

<p><sup>2</sup> Why is Your apparel splashed with red, and Your garments like the one who treads in the winepress?

<p><sup>3</sup> I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no one with Me. I trod them in My anger and trampled them in My wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon My garments, and I stained all My raiment.

<p><sup>4</sup> For the day of vengeance was in My heart, and My year of redemption <font color='#7a8080'>[the year of My redeemed]</font> has come.

<p><sup>5</sup> And I looked, but there was no one to help; I was amazed <i>and</i> appalled that there was no one to uphold <font color='#7a8080'>[truth and right]</font>. So My own arm brought Me victory, and My wrath upheld Me.

<p><sup>6</sup> I trod down the peoples in My anger and made them drink of the cup of My wrath until they were intoxicated, and I spilled their lifeblood upon the earth.

<p><sup>7</sup> I will recount the loving-kindnesses of the Lord and the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, according to all that the Lord has bestowed on us, and the great goodness to the house of Israel, which He has granted them according to His mercy and according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.

<p><sup>8</sup> For He said, Surely they are My people, sons who will not lie <font color='#7a8080'>[who will not deal falsely with Me]</font>; and so He was to them a Savior <font color='#7a8080'>[in all their distresses]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.

<p><sup>10</sup> But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit; therefore He turned to become their enemy and Himself fought against them.

<p><sup>11</sup> Then His people <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remembered the days of old, of Moses and his people <font color='#7a8080'>[and they said]</font>, Where is He Who brought <font color='#7a8080'>[our fathers]</font> up out of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Red]</font> Sea, with <font color='#7a8080'>[Moses and the other]</font> shepherds of His flock? Where is He Who put His Holy Spirit within their midst,

<p><sup>12</sup> Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, dividing the waters before them, to make for Himself an everlasting name,

<p><sup>13</sup> Who led them through the depths, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble?

<p><sup>14</sup> Like the cattle that go down into the valley <font color='#7a8080'>[to find better pasturage, refuge, and rest]</font>, the Spirit of the Lord caused them to rest. So did You lead Your people <font color='#7a8080'>[Lord]</font> to make for Yourself a beautiful <i>and</i> glorious name <font color='#7a8080'>[to prepare the way for the acknowledgment of Your name by all nations]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> Look down from heaven and see from the dwelling place of Your holiness and Your glory. Where are Your zeal <i>and</i> Your jealousy and Your mighty acts <font color='#7a8080'>[which you formerly did for Your people]</font>? Your yearning pity and the <font color='#7a8080'>[multitude of]</font> compassions of Your heart are restrained <i>and</i> withheld from me.

<p><sup>16</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[surely]</font> You are our Father, even though Abraham <font color='#7a8080'>[our ancestor]</font> does not know us and Israel (Jacob) does not acknowledge us; You, O Lord, are <font color='#7a8080'>[still]</font> our Father, our Redeemer from everlasting is Your name.

<p><sup>17</sup> O Lord, why have You made us <font color='#7a8080'>[able]</font> to err from Your ways and hardened our hearts to <font color='#7a8080'>[reverential]</font> fear of You? Return <font color='#7a8080'>[to bless us]</font> for Your servants' sake, the tribes of Your heritage.

<p><sup>18</sup> Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary but a little while; our adversaries have trodden it down.

<p><sup>19</sup> We have become <font color='#7a8080'>[to You]</font> like those over whom You never exercised rule, like those who were not called by Your name.

<h4>64</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Oh, that You would rend the heavens and that You would come down, that the mountains might quake <i>and</i> flow down at Your presence—

<p><sup>2</sup> As when fire kindles the brushwood and the fire causes the waters to boil—to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!

<p><sup>3</sup> When You did terrible things which we did not expect, You came down; the mountains quaked at Your presence.

<p><sup>4</sup> For from of old no one has heard nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who works <i>and</i> shows Himself active on behalf of him who <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> waits for Him.

<p><sup>5</sup> You meet <i>and</i> spare him who joyfully works righteousness (uprightness and justice), <font color='#7a8080'>[earnestly]</font> remembering You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned; we have long continued in our sins <font color='#7a8080'>[prolonging Your anger]</font>. And shall we be saved?

<p><sup>6</sup> For we have all become like one who is unclean <font color='#7a8080'>[ceremonially, like a leper]</font>, and all our righteousness (our best deeds of rightness and justice) is like filthy rags <i>or</i> a polluted garment; we all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away <font color='#7a8080'>[far from God's favor, hurrying us toward destruction]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> And no one calls on Your name and awakens <i>and</i> bestirs himself to take <i>and</i> keep hold of You; for You have hidden Your face from us and have delivered us into the <font color='#7a8080'>[consuming]</font> power of our iniquities.

<p><sup>8</sup> Yet, O Lord, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You our Potter, and we all are the work of Your hand.

<p><sup>9</sup> Do not be exceedingly angry, O Lord, or <font color='#7a8080'>[seriously]</font> remember iniquity forever. Behold, consider, we beseech You, we are all Your people.

<p><sup>10</sup> Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

<p><sup>11</sup> Our holy and our beautiful house, <font color='#7a8080'>[the temple]</font> where our fathers praised You, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant <i>and</i> desirable places are in ruins.

<p><sup>12</sup> Considering these <font color='#7a8080'>[calamities]</font>, will You restrain Yourself, O Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[and not come to our aid]</font>? Will You keep silent <i>and</i> not command our deliverance but humble <i>and</i> afflict us exceedingly?

<h4>65</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> I was <font color='#7a8080'>[ready to be]</font> inquired of by those who asked not; I was <font color='#7a8080'>[ready to be]</font> found by those who sought Me not. I said, Here I am, here I am <font color='#7a8080'>[says <b>I Am</b>]</font> to a nation <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> that has not called on My name.

<p><sup>2</sup> I have spread out My hands all the day long to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts—

<p><sup>3</sup> A people who provoke Me to My face continually, sacrificing <font color='#7a8080'>[to idols]</font> in gardens and burning incense upon bricks <font color='#7a8080'>[instead of at God's prescribed altar]</font>;

<p><sup>4</sup> Who sit among the graves <font color='#7a8080'>[trying to talk with the dead]</font> and lodge among the secret places <font color='#7a8080'>[or caves where familiar spirits were thought to dwell]</font>; who eat swine's flesh, and the broth of abominable <i>and</i> loathsome things is in their vessels;

<p><sup>5</sup> Who say, Keep to yourself; do not come near me, for I am set apart from you <font color='#7a8080'>[and lest I sanctify you]</font>! These are smoke in My nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.

<p><sup>6</sup> Behold, it is written before Me: I will not keep silence but will repay; yes, I will repay into their bosom

<p><sup>7</sup> Both your own iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers, says the Lord. Because they too burned incense upon the mountains and reviled <i>and</i> blasphemed Me upon the hills, therefore will I measure <i>and</i> stretch out their former doings into their own bosom.

<p><sup>8</sup> Thus says the Lord: As the juice <font color='#7a8080'>[of the grape]</font> is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it, so will I do for My servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.

<p><sup>9</sup> And I will bring forth an offspring from Jacob, and from Judah an inheritor of My mountains; My chosen <i>and</i> elect will inherit it, and My servants will dwell there.

<p><sup>10</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[the plain of]</font> Sharon shall be a pasture <i>and</i> fold for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for My people who seek Me, inquire of Me, <i>and</i> require Me <font color='#7a8080'>[by right of their necessity and by right of My invitation]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> But you who forsake the Lord, who forget <i>and</i> ignore My holy Mount <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font>, who prepare a table for Gad <font color='#7a8080'>[the Babylonian god of fortune]</font> and who furnish mixed drinks for Meni <font color='#7a8080'>[the god of destiny]</font>—

<p><sup>12</sup> I will destine you <font color='#7a8080'>[says the Lord]</font> for the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter, because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen <i>or</i> obey. But you did what was evil in My eyes, and you chose that in which I did not delight.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, My servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame.

<p><sup>14</sup> Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry out for pain <i>and</i> sorrow of heart and shall wail <i>and</i> howl for anguish, vexation, <i>and</i> breaking of spirit.

<p><sup>15</sup> And you will leave your name to My chosen <font color='#7a8080'>[to those who will use it]</font> for a curse; and the Lord God will slay you, but He will call His servants by another name <font color='#7a8080'>[as much greater than the former name as the name Israel was greater than the name Jacob]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> So <font color='#7a8080'>[it shall be]</font> that he who invokes a blessing on himself in the land shall do so by saying, May the God of truth <i>and</i> fidelity <font color='#7a8080'>[the Amen]</font> bless me; and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth <i>and</i> faithfulness to His promises <font color='#7a8080'>[the Amen]</font>, because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hidden from My eyes.

<p><sup>17</sup> For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.

<p><sup>18</sup> But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a rejoicing and her people a joy.

<p><sup>19</sup> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; and the sound of weeping will no more be heard in it, nor the cry of distress.

<p><sup>20</sup> There shall no more be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who dies prematurely; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner who dies when only a hundred years old shall be <font color='#7a8080'>[thought only a child, cut off because he is]</font> accursed.

<p><sup>21</sup> They shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.

<p><sup>22</sup> They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat <font color='#7a8080'>[the fruit]</font>. For as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of My people, and My chosen <i>and</i> elect shall long make use of <i>and</i> enjoy the work of their hands.

<p><sup>23</sup> They shall not labor in vain or bring forth <font color='#7a8080'>[children]</font> for sudden terror <i>or</i> calamity; for they shall be the descendants of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.

<p><sup>24</sup> And it shall be that before they call I will answer; and while they are yet speaking I will hear.

<p><sup>25</sup> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all My holy Mount <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font>, says the Lord.

<h4>66</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Thus says the Lord: Heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. What kind of house would you build for Me? And what kind can be My resting-place?

<p><sup>2</sup> For all these things My hand has made, and so all these things have come into being <font color='#7a8080'>[by and for Me]</font>, says the Lord. But this is the man to whom I will look <i>and</i> have regard: he who is humble and of a broken <i>or</i> wounded spirit, and who trembles at My word <i>and</i> reveres My commands.

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The acts of the hypocrite's worship are as abominable to God as if they were offered to idols.]</font> He who kills an ox <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> will be as guilty as if he slew <i>and</i> sacrificed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb <i>or</i> a kid, as if he broke a dog's neck <i>and</i> sacrificed him; he who offers a cereal offering, as if he offered swine's blood; he who burns incense <font color='#7a8080'>[to God]</font>, as if he blessed an idol. <font color='#7a8080'>[Such people]</font> have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their abominations;

<p><sup>4</sup> So I also will choose their delusions <i>and</i> mockings, their calamities <i>and</i> afflictions, and I will bring their fears upon them—because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen <i>or</i> obey. But they did what was evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.

<p><sup>5</sup> Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word: Your brethren who hate you, who cast you out for My name's sake, have said, Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy! But it is they who shall be put to shame.

<p><sup>6</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Hark!]</font> An uproar from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of the Lord, rendering recompense to His enemies!

<p><sup>7</sup> Before <font color='#7a8080'>[Zion]</font> travailed, she gave birth; before her pain came upon her, she was delivered of a male child.

<p><sup>8</sup> Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Or shall a nation be brought forth in a moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she brought forth her children.

<p><sup>9</sup> Shall I bring to the <font color='#7a8080'>[moment of]</font> birth and not cause to bring forth? says the Lord. Shall I Who causes to bring forth shut the womb? says your God.

<p><sup>10</sup> Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her,

<p><sup>11</sup> That you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breasts, that you may drink deeply and be delighted with the abundance <i>and</i> brightness of her glory.

<p><sup>12</sup> For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; then you will be nursed, you will be carried on her hip and trotted <font color='#7a8080'>[lovingly bounced up and down]</font> on her <font color='#7a8080'>[God's maternal]</font> knees.

<p><sup>13</sup> As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

<p><sup>14</sup> When you see this, your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like green <i>and</i> tender grass. And the <font color='#7a8080'>[powerful]</font> hand of the Lord shall be revealed <i>and</i> known to be with His servants, but His indignation <font color='#7a8080'>[shown]</font> to be against His enemies.

<p><sup>15</sup> For behold, the Lord will come in fire, and His chariots will be like the stormy wind, to render His anger with fierceness, and His rebuke with flames of fire.

<p><sup>16</sup> For by fire and by His sword will the Lord execute judgment upon all flesh, and the slain of the Lord will be many.

<p><sup>17</sup> Those who <font color='#7a8080'>[attempt to]</font> sanctify themselves and cleanse themselves to enter <font color='#7a8080'>[and sacrifice to idols]</font> in the gardens, following after one in the midst, eating hog's flesh and the abomination <font color='#7a8080'>[creeping things]</font> and the <font color='#7a8080'>[mouse—their works and their thoughts]</font> shall come to an end together, says the Lord.

<p><sup>18</sup> For I know their works and their thoughts. And the time is coming when I will gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see My glory.

<p><sup>19</sup> And I will set up a <font color='#7a8080'>[miraculous]</font> sign among them, and from them I will send survivors to the nations—to Tarshish, Pul (Put), and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles <i>and</i> coastlands afar off that have not heard of My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare <i>and</i> proclaim My glory among the nations.

<p><sup>20</sup> And they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as an offering to the Lord—upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon camels—to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, just as the children of Israel bring their cereal offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord.

<p><sup>21</sup> And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says the Lord.

<p><sup>22</sup> For as the new heavens and the new earth which I make shall remain before Me, says the Lord, so shall your offspring and your name remain.

<p><sup>23</sup> And it shall be that from one New Moon to another New Moon and from one Sabbath to another Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>24</sup> And they shall go forth and gaze upon the dead bodies of the <font color='#7a8080'>[rebellious]</font> men who have stepped over against Me; for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all mankind.
