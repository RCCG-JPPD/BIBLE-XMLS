<h4>1</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> From Paul, a bond servant of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) called to be an apostle, (a special messenger) set apart to <font color='#7a8080'>[preach]</font> the Gospel (good news) of <i>and</i> from God,
<p><sup>2</sup> Which He promised in advance <font color='#7a8080'>[long ago]</font> through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures—

<p><sup>3</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[The Gospel]</font> regarding His Son, Who as to the flesh (His human nature) was descended from David,

<p><sup>4</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[as to His divine nature]</font> according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated the Son of God in power <font color='#7a8080'>[in a striking, triumphant and miraculous manner]</font> by His resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ our Lord (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

<p><sup>5</sup> It is through Him that we have received grace (God's unmerited favor) and <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> apostleship to promote obedience to the faith <i>and</i> make disciples for His name's sake among all the nations,

<p><sup>6</sup> And this includes you, called of Jesus Christ <i>and</i> invited <font color='#7a8080'>[as you are]</font> to belong to Him.

<p><sup>7</sup> To <font color='#7a8080'>[you then]</font> all God's beloved ones in Rome, called to be saints <i>and</i> designated for a consecrated life: Grace <i>and</i> spiritual blessing and peace be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

<p><sup>8</sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because <font color='#7a8080'>[the report of]</font> your faith is made known to all the world <i>and</i> is commended everywhere.

<p><sup>9</sup> For God is my witness, Whom I serve with my <font color='#7a8080'>[whole]</font> spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[rendering priestly and spiritual service]</font> in <font color='#7a8080'>[preaching]</font> the Gospel <i>and</i> <font color='#7a8080'>[telling]</font> the good news of His Son, how incessantly I always mention you when at my prayers.

<p><sup>10</sup> I keep pleading that somehow by God's will I may now at last prosper <i>and</i> come to you.

<p><sup>11</sup> For I am yearning to see you, that I may impart <i>and</i> share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen <i>and</i> establish you;

<p><sup>12</sup> That is, that we may be mutually strengthened <i>and</i> encouraged <i>and</i> comforted by each other's faith, both yours and mine.

<p><sup>13</sup> I want you to know, brethren, that many times I have planned <i>and</i> intended to come to you, though thus far I have been hindered <i>and</i> prevented, in order that I might have some fruit (some result of my labors) among you, as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.

<p><sup>14</sup> Both to Greeks and to barbarians (to the cultured and to the uncultured), both to the wise and the foolish, I have an obligation to discharge <i>and</i> a duty to perform <i>and</i> a debt to pay.

<p><sup>15</sup> So, for my part, I am willing <i>and</i> eagerly ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome.

<p><sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Gospel (good news) <i>of Christ</i>, for it is God's power working unto salvation <font color='#7a8080'>[for deliverance from eternal death]</font> to everyone who believes <i>with</i> a personal trust <i>and</i> a confident surrender <i>and</i> firm reliance, to the Jew first and also to the Greek,

<p><sup>17</sup> For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith <font color='#7a8080'>[disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]</font>. As it is written, The man who through faith is just <i>and</i> upright shall live <i>and</i> shall live by faith.

<p><sup>18</sup> For God's <font color='#7a8080'>[holy]</font> wrath <i>and</i> indignation are revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who in their wickedness repress <i>and</i> hinder the truth <i>and</i> make it inoperative.

<p><sup>19</sup> For that which is known about God is evident to them <i>and</i> made plain in their inner consciousness, because God <font color='#7a8080'>[Himself]</font> has shown it to them.

<p><sup>20</sup> For ever since the creation of the world His invisible nature <i>and</i> attributes, that is, His eternal power and divinity, have been made intelligible <i>and</i> clearly discernible in <i>and</i> through the things that have been made (His handiworks). So <font color='#7a8080'>[men]</font> are without excuse <font color='#7a8080'>[altogether without any defense or justification]</font>,

<p><sup>21</sup> Because when they knew <i>and</i> recognized Him as God, they did not honor <i>and</i> glorify Him as God or give Him thanks. But instead they became futile <i>and</i> godless in their thinking <font color='#7a8080'>[with vain imaginings, foolish reasoning, and stupid speculations]</font> and their senseless minds were darkened.

<p><sup>22</sup> Claiming to be wise, they became fools <font color='#7a8080'>[professing to be smart, they made simpletons of themselves]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> And by them the glory and majesty <i>and</i> excellence of the immortal God were exchanged for <i>and</i> represented by images, resembling mortal man and birds and beasts and reptiles.

<p><sup>24</sup> Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> hearts to sexual impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves <font color='#7a8080'>[abandoning them to the degrading power of sin]</font>,

<p><sup>25</sup> Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed forever! Amen (so be it).

<p><sup>26</sup> For this reason God gave them over <i>and</i> abandoned them to vile affections <i>and</i> degrading passions. For their women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural <i>and</i> abnormal one,

<p><sup>27</sup> And the men also turned from natural relations with women and were set ablaze (burning out, consumed) with lust for one another—men committing shameful acts with men and suffering in their own bodies <i>and</i> personalities the inevitable consequences <i>and</i> penalty of their wrong-doing <i>and</i> going astray, which was <font color='#7a8080'>[their]</font> fitting retribution.

<p><sup>28</sup> And so, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God <i>or</i> approve of Him <i>or</i> consider Him worth the knowing, God gave them over to a base <i>and</i> condemned mind to do things not proper <i>or</i> decent <i>but</i> loathsome,

<p><sup>29</sup> Until they were filled (permeated and saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness, iniquity, grasping <i>and</i> covetous greed, and malice. <font color='#7a8080'>[They were]</font> full of envy <i>and</i> jealousy, murder, strife, deceit <i>and</i> treachery, ill will <i>and</i> cruel ways. <font color='#7a8080'>[They were]</font> secret backbiters <i>and</i> gossipers,

<p><sup>30</sup> Slanderers, hateful to <i>and</i> hating God, full of insolence, arrogance, <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> boasting; inventors of new forms of evil, disobedient <i>and</i> undutiful to parents.

<p><sup>31</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[They were]</font> without understanding, conscienceless <i>and</i> faithless, heartless <i>and</i> loveless <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> merciless.

<p><sup>32</sup> Though they are fully aware of God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them themselves but approve <i>and</i> applaud others who practice them.

<h4>2</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Therefore you have no excuse <i>or</i> defense <i>or</i> justification, O man, whoever you are who judges <i>and</i> condemns another. For in posing as judge <i>and</i> passing sentence on another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge are habitually practicing the very same things <font color='#7a8080'>[that you censure and denounce]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But]</font> we know that the judgment (adverse verdict, sentence) of God falls justly <i>and</i> in accordance with truth upon those who practice such things.

<p><sup>3</sup> And do you think <i>or</i> imagine, O man, when you judge <i>and</i> condemn those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape God's judgment <i>and</i> elude His sentence <i>and</i> adverse verdict?

<p><sup>4</sup> Or are you <font color='#7a8080'>[so blind as to]</font> trifle with <i>and</i> presume upon <i>and</i> despise <i>and</i> underestimate the wealth of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering patience? Are you unmindful <i>or</i> actually ignorant <font color='#7a8080'>[of the fact]</font> that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repent (to change your mind and inner man to accept God's will)?

<p><sup>5</sup> But by your callous stubbornness <i>and</i> impenitence of heart you are storing up wrath <i>and</i> indignation for yourself on the day of wrath <i>and</i> indignation, when God's righteous judgment (just doom) will be revealed.

<p><sup>6</sup> For He will render to every man according to his works <font color='#7a8080'>[justly, as his deeds deserve]</font>:

<p><sup>7</sup> To those who by patient persistence in well-doing <font color='#7a8080'>[springing from piety]</font> seek <font color='#7a8080'>[unseen but sure]</font> glory and honor and <font color='#7a8080'>[the eternal blessedness of]</font> immortality, He will give eternal life.

<p><sup>8</sup> But for those who are self-seeking <i>and</i> self-willed <i>and</i> disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness, there will be indignation and wrath.

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[And]</font> there will be tribulation <i>and</i> anguish and calamity <i>and</i> constraint for every soul of man who <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile).

<p><sup>10</sup> But glory and honor and <font color='#7a8080'>[heart]</font> peace shall be awarded to everyone who <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> does good, the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile).

<p><sup>11</sup> For God shows no partiality <font color='#7a8080'>[undue favor or unfairness; with Him one man is not different from another]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without <font color='#7a8080'>[regard to]</font> the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged <i>and</i> condemned by the Law.

<p><sup>13</sup> For it is not merely hearing the Law <font color='#7a8080'>[read]</font> that makes one righteous before God, but it is the doers of the Law who will be held guiltless <i>and</i> acquitted <i>and</i> justified.

<p><sup>14</sup> When Gentiles who have not the <font color='#7a8080'>[divine]</font> Law do instinctively what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, since they do not have the Law.

<p><sup>15</sup> They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts <i>and</i> are operating there, with which their consciences (sense of right and wrong) also bear witness; and their <font color='#7a8080'>[moral]</font> decisions (their arguments of reason, their condemning or approving thoughts) will accuse or perhaps defend <i>and</i> excuse <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font>

<p><sup>16</sup> On that day when, as my Gospel proclaims, God by Jesus Christ will judge men in regard to the things which they conceal (their hidden thoughts).

<p><sup>17</sup> But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law and pride yourselves in God <i>and</i> your relationship to Him,

<p><sup>18</sup> And know <i>and</i> understand His will and discerningly approve the better things <i>and</i> have a sense of what is vital, because you are instructed by the Law;

<p><sup>19</sup> And if you are confident that you <font color='#7a8080'>[yourself]</font> are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, and <font color='#7a8080'>[that

<p><sup>20</sup> You are]</font> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the childish, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—

<p><sup>21</sup> Well then, you who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you teach against stealing, do you steal (take what does not really belong to you)?

<p><sup>22</sup> You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery <font color='#7a8080'>[are you unchaste in action or in thought]</font>? You who abhor <i>and</i> loathe idols, do you rob temples <font color='#7a8080'>[do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to God, thus robbing the sanctuary and doing sacrilege]</font>?

<p><sup>23</sup> You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law <font color='#7a8080'>[by stealthily infringing upon or carelessly neglecting or openly breaking it]</font>?

<p><sup>24</sup> For, as it is written, The name of God is maligned <i>and</i> blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you! <font color='#7a8080'>[The words to this effect are from your own Scriptures.]</font>

<p><sup>25</sup> Circumcision does indeed profit if you keep the Law; but if you habitually transgress the Law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.

<p><sup>26</sup> So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be credited to him as <font color='#7a8080'>[equivalent to]</font> circumcision?

<p><sup>27</sup> Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the Law will condemn you who, although you have the code in writing and have circumcision, break the Law.

<p><sup>28</sup> For he is not a <font color='#7a8080'>[real]</font> Jew who is only one outwardly <i>and</i> publicly, nor is <font color='#7a8080'>[true]</font> circumcision something external and physical.

<p><sup>29</sup> But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and <font color='#7a8080'>[true]</font> circumcision is of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal <font color='#7a8080'>[matter]</font>. His praise is not from men but from God.

<h4>3</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then what advantage remains to the Jew? <font color='#7a8080'>[How is he favored?]</font> Or what is the value <i>or</i> benefit of circumcision?

<p><sup>2</sup> Much in every way. To begin with, to the Jews were entrusted the oracles (the brief communications, the intentions, the utterances) of God.

<p><sup>3</sup> What if some did not believe <i>and</i> were without faith? Does their lack of faith <i>and</i> their faithlessness nullify <i>and</i> make ineffective <i>and</i> void the faithfulness of God <i>and</i> His fidelity <font color='#7a8080'>[to His Word]</font>?

<p><sup>4</sup> By no means! Let God be found true though every human being is false <i>and</i> a liar, as it is written, That You may be justified <i>and</i> shown to be upright in what You say, and prevail when You are judged <font color='#7a8080'>[by sinful men]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> But if our unrighteousness thus establishes <i>and</i> exhibits the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust <i>and</i> wrong to inflict His wrath upon us <font color='#7a8080'>[Jews]</font>? I speak in a <font color='#7a8080'>[purely]</font> human way.

<p><sup>6</sup> By no means! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?

<p><sup>7</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[you say]</font> if through my falsehood God's integrity is magnified <i>and</i> advertised <i>and</i> abounds to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?

<p><sup>8</sup> And why should we not do evil that good may come?—as some slanderously charge us with teaching. Such <font color='#7a8080'>[false teaching]</font> is justly condemned by them.

<p><sup>9</sup> Well then, are we <font color='#7a8080'>[Jews]</font> superior <i>and</i> better off than they? No, not at all. We have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), are under sin <font color='#7a8080'>[held down by and subject to its power and control]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> As it is written, None is righteous, just <i>and</i> truthful <i>and</i> upright <i>and</i> conscientious, no, not one.

<p><sup>11</sup> No one understands <font color='#7a8080'>[no one intelligently discerns <i>or</i> comprehends]</font>; no one seeks out God.

<p><sup>12</sup> All have turned aside; together they have gone wrong <i>and</i> have become unprofitable <i>and</i> worthless; no one does right, not even one!

<p><sup>13</sup> Their throat is a yawning grave; they use their tongues to deceive (to mislead and to deal treacherously). The venom of asps is beneath their lips.

<p><sup>14</sup> Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.

<p><sup>15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood.

<p><sup>16</sup> Destruction <font color='#7a8080'>[as it dashes them to pieces]</font> and misery mark their ways.

<p><sup>17</sup> And they have no experience of the way of peace <font color='#7a8080'>[they know nothing about peace, for a peaceful way they do not even recognize]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> There is no <font color='#7a8080'>[reverential]</font> fear of God before their eyes.

<p><sup>19</sup> Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that <font color='#7a8080'>[the murmurs and excuses of]</font> every mouth may be hushed and all the world may be held accountable to God.

<p><sup>20</sup> For no person will be justified (made righteous, acquitted, and judged acceptable) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law. For <font color='#7a8080'>[the real function of]</font> the Law is to make men recognize <i>and</i> be conscious of sin <font color='#7a8080'>[not mere perception, but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance, faith, and holy character]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> But now the righteousness of God has been revealed independently <i>and</i> altogether apart from the Law, although actually it is attested by the Law and the Prophets,

<p><sup>22</sup> Namely, the righteousness of God which comes by believing <i>with</i> personal trust <i>and</i> confident reliance on Jesus Christ (the Messiah). <font color='#7a8080'>[And it is meant]</font> for all who believe. For there is no distinction,

<p><sup>23</sup> Since all have sinned and are falling short of the honor <i>and</i> glory which God bestows <i>and</i> receives.

<p><sup>24</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[All]</font> are justified <i>and</i> made upright <i>and</i> in right standing with God, freely <i>and</i> gratuitously by His grace (His unmerited favor and mercy), through the redemption which is <font color='#7a8080'>[provided]</font> in Christ Jesus,

<p><sup>25</sup> Whom God put forward <font color='#7a8080'>[before the eyes of all]</font> as a mercy seat <i>and</i> propitiation by His blood <font color='#7a8080'>[the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation, to be received]</font> through faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in His divine forbearance He had passed over <i>and</i> ignored former sins without punishment.

<p><sup>26</sup> It was to demonstrate <i>and</i> prove at the present time (in the now season) that He Himself is righteous and that He justifies <i>and</i> accepts as righteous him who has <font color='#7a8080'>[true]</font> faith in Jesus.

<p><sup>27</sup> Then what becomes of <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> pride <i>and</i> <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> boasting? It is excluded (banished, ruled out entirely). On what principle? <font color='#7a8080'>[On the principle]</font> of doing good deeds? No, but on the principle of faith.

<p><sup>28</sup> For we hold that a man is justified <i>and</i> made upright by faith independent of <i>and</i> distinctly apart from good deeds (works of the Law). <font color='#7a8080'>[The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification.]</font>

<p><sup>29</sup> Or is God merely <font color='#7a8080'>[the God]</font> of Jews? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,

<p><sup>30</sup> Since it is one and the same God Who will justify the circumcised by faith <font color='#7a8080'>[which germinated from Abraham]</font> and the uncircumcised through their <font color='#7a8080'>[newly acquired]</font> faith. <font color='#7a8080'>[For it is the same trusting faith in both cases, a firmly relying faith in Jesus Christ]</font>.

<p><sup>31</sup> Do we then by <font color='#7a8080'>[this]</font> faith make the Law of no effect, overthrow it <i>or</i> make it a dead letter? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm <i>and</i> establish <i>and</i> uphold the Law.

<h4>4</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But]</font> if so, what shall we say about Abraham, our forefather humanly speaking—<font color='#7a8080'>[what did he]</font> find out? <font color='#7a8080'>[How does this affect his position, and what was gained by him?]</font>

<p><sup>2</sup> For if Abraham was justified (established as just by acquittal from guilt) by good works <font color='#7a8080'>[that he did, then]</font> he has grounds for boasting. But not before God!

<p><sup>3</sup> For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed in (trusted in) God, and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living and right standing with God).

<p><sup>4</sup> Now to a laborer, his wages are not counted as a favor <i>or</i> a gift, but as an obligation (something owed to him).

<p><sup>5</sup> But to one who, not working <font color='#7a8080'>[by the Law]</font>, trusts (believes fully) in Him Who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited to him as righteousness (the standing acceptable to God).

<p><sup>6</sup> Thus David congratulates the man <i>and</i> pronounces a blessing on him to whom God credits righteousness apart from the works he does:

<p><sup>7</sup> Blessed <i>and</i> happy <i>and</i> to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up <i>and</i> completely buried.

<p><sup>8</sup> Blessed <i>and</i> happy <i>and</i> to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account <i>nor</i> reckon it against him.

<p><sup>9</sup> Is this blessing (happiness) then meant only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.

<p><sup>10</sup> How then was it credited <font color='#7a8080'>[to him]</font>? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.

<p><sup>11</sup> He received the mark of circumcision as a token <i>or</i> an evidence <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised—<font color='#7a8080'>[faith]</font> so that he was to be made the father of all who <font color='#7a8080'>[truly]</font> believe, though without circumcision, and who thus have righteousness (right standing with God) imputed to them <i>and</i> credited to their account,

<p><sup>12</sup> As well as <font color='#7a8080'>[that he be made]</font> the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised, but also walk in the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

<p><sup>13</sup> For the promise to Abraham or his posterity, that he should inherit the world, did not come through <font color='#7a8080'>[observing the commands of]</font> the Law but through the righteousness of faith.

<p><sup>14</sup> If it is the adherents of the Law who are to be the heirs, then faith is made futile <i>and</i> empty of all meaning and the promise <font color='#7a8080'>[of God]</font> is made void (is annulled and has no power).

<p><sup>15</sup> For the Law results in <font color='#7a8080'>[divine]</font> wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression <font color='#7a8080'>[of it either]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> Therefore, <font color='#7a8080'>[inheriting]</font> the promise is the outcome of faith <i>and</i> depends <font color='#7a8080'>[entirely]</font> on faith, in order that it might be given as an act of grace (unmerited favor), to make it stable <i>and</i> valid <i>and</i> guaranteed to all his descendants—not only to the devotees <i>and</i> adherents of the Law, but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, who is <font color='#7a8080'>[thus]</font> the father of us all.

<p><sup>17</sup> As it is written, I have made you the father of many nations. <font color='#7a8080'>[He was appointed our father]</font> in the sight of God in Whom he believed, Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that <font color='#7a8080'>[He has foretold and promised]</font> as if they <font color='#7a8080'>[already]</font> existed.

<p><sup>18</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[For Abraham, human reason for]</font> hope being gone, hoped in faith that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been promised, So <font color='#7a8080'>[numberless]</font> shall your descendants be.

<p><sup>19</sup> He did not weaken in faith when he considered the <font color='#7a8080'>[utter]</font> impotence of his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or <font color='#7a8080'>[when he considered]</font> the barrenness of Sarah's <font color='#7a8080'>[deadened]</font> womb.

<p><sup>20</sup> No unbelief <i>or</i> distrust made him waver (doubtingly question) concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong <i>and</i> was empowered by faith as he gave praise <i>and</i> glory to God,

<p><sup>21</sup> Fully satisfied <i>and</i> assured that God was able <i>and</i> mighty to keep His word <i>and</i> to do what He had promised.

<p><sup>22</sup> That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God).

<p><sup>23</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[the words]</font>, It was credited to him, were written not for his sake alone,

<p><sup>24</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[they were written]</font> for our sakes too. <font color='#7a8080'>[Righteousness, standing acceptable to God]</font> will be granted <i>and</i> credited to us also who believe in (trust in, adhere to, and rely on) God, Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,

<p><sup>25</sup> Who was betrayed <i>and</i> put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification (our acquittal), <font color='#7a8080'>[making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God]</font>.

<h4>5</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, since we are justified (acquitted, declared righteous, and given a right standing with God) through faith, let us <font color='#7a8080'>[grasp the fact that we]</font> have <font color='#7a8080'>[the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy]</font> peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

<p><sup>2</sup> Through Him also we have <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> access (entrance, introduction) by faith into this grace (state of God's favor) in which we <font color='#7a8080'>[firmly and safely]</font> stand. And let us rejoice <i>and</i> exult in our hope of experiencing <i>and</i> enjoying the glory of God.

<p><sup>3</sup> Moreover <font color='#7a8080'>[let us also be full of joy now!]</font> let us exult <i>and</i> triumph in our troubles <i>and</i> rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that pressure <i>and</i> affliction <i>and</i> hardship produce patient <i>and</i> unswerving endurance.

<p><sup>4</sup> And endurance (fortitude) develops maturity of character (approved faith and tried integrity). And character <font color='#7a8080'>[of this sort]</font> produces <font color='#7a8080'>[the habit of]</font> joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation.

<p><sup>5</sup> Such hope never disappoints <i>or</i> deludes <i>or</i> shames us, for God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us.

<p><sup>6</sup> While we were yet in weakness <font color='#7a8080'>[powerless to help ourselves]</font>, at the fitting time Christ died for (in behalf of) the ungodly.

<p><sup>7</sup> Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a noble <i>and</i> lovable <i>and</i> generous benefactor someone might even dare to die.

<p><sup>8</sup> But God shows <i>and</i> clearly proves His <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for us.

<p><sup>9</sup> Therefore, since we are now justified (acquitted, made righteous, and brought into right relationship with God) by Christ's blood, how much more <font color='#7a8080'>[certain is it that]</font> we shall be saved by Him from the indignation <i>and</i> wrath of God.

<p><sup>10</sup> For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, it is much more <font color='#7a8080'>[certain]</font>, now that we are reconciled, that we shall be saved (daily delivered from sin's dominion) through His <font color='#7a8080'>[resurrection]</font> life.

<p><sup>11</sup> Not only so, but we also rejoice <i>and</i> exultingly glory in God <font color='#7a8080'>[in His love and perfection]</font> through our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom we have now received <i>and</i> enjoy <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> reconciliation.

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man, and death as the result of sin, so death spread to all men, <font color='#7a8080'>[no one being able to stop it or to escape its power]</font> because all men sinned.

<p><sup>13</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[To be sure]</font> sin was in the world before ever the Law was given, but sin is not charged to men's account where there is no law <font color='#7a8080'>[to transgress]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> Yet death held sway from Adam to Moses <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lawgiver]</font>, even over those who did not themselves transgress <font color='#7a8080'>[a positive command]</font> as Adam did. Adam was a type (prefigure) of the One Who was to come <font color='#7a8080'>[in reverse, the former destructive, the Latter saving]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> But God's free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass <font color='#7a8080'>[His grace is out of all proportion to the fall of man]</font>. For if many died through one man's falling away (his lapse, his offense), much more profusely did God's grace and the free gift <font color='#7a8080'>[that comes]</font> through the undeserved favor of the one Man Jesus Christ abound <i>and</i> overflow to <i>and</i> for <font color='#7a8080'>[the benefit of]</font> many.

<p><sup>16</sup> Nor is the free gift at all to be compared to the effect of that one <font color='#7a8080'>[man's]</font> sin. For the sentence <font color='#7a8080'>[following the trespass]</font> of one <font color='#7a8080'>[man]</font> brought condemnation, whereas the free gift <font color='#7a8080'>[following]</font> many transgressions brings justification (an act of righteousness).

<p><sup>17</sup> For if because of one man's trespass (lapse, offense) death reigned through that one, much more surely will those who receive <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> overflowing grace (unmerited favor) and the free gift of righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[putting them into right standing with Himself]</font> reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

<p><sup>18</sup> Well then, as one man's trespass <font color='#7a8080'>[one man's false step and falling away led]</font> to condemnation for all men, so one Man's act of righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[leads]</font> to acquittal <i>and</i> right standing with God and life for all men.

<p><sup>19</sup> For just as by one man's disobedience (failing to hear, heedlessness, and carelessness) the many were constituted sinners, so by one Man's obedience the many will be constituted righteous (made acceptable to God, brought into right standing with Him).

<p><sup>20</sup> But then Law came in, <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> to expand <i>and</i> increase the trespass <font color='#7a8080'>[making it more apparent and exciting opposition]</font>. But where sin increased <i>and</i> abounded, grace (God's unmerited favor) has surpassed it <i>and</i> increased the more <i>and</i> superabounded,

<p><sup>21</sup> So that, <font color='#7a8080'>[just]</font> as sin has reigned in death, <font color='#7a8080'>[so]</font> grace (His unearned and undeserved favor) might reign also through righteousness (right standing with God) which issues in eternal life through Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) our Lord.

<h4>6</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> What shall we say <font color='#7a8080'>[to all this]</font>? Are we to remain in sin in order that God's grace (favor and mercy) may multiply <i>and</i> overflow?

<p><sup>2</sup> Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?

<p><sup>3</sup> Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?

<p><sup>4</sup> We were buried therefore with Him by the baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious <font color='#7a8080'>[power]</font> of the Father, so we too might <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> live <i>and</i> behave in newness of life.

<p><sup>5</sup> For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His, we shall also be <font color='#7a8080'>[one with Him in sharing]</font> His resurrection <font color='#7a8080'>[by a new life lived for God]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> We know that our old (unrenewed) self was nailed to the cross with Him in order that <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> body <font color='#7a8080'>[which is the instrument]</font> of sin might be made ineffective <i>and</i> inactive for evil, that we might no longer be the slaves of sin.

<p><sup>7</sup> For when a man dies, he is freed (loosed, delivered) from <font color='#7a8080'>[the power of]</font> sin <font color='#7a8080'>[among men]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,

<p><sup>9</sup> Because we know that Christ (the Anointed One), being once raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him.

<p><sup>10</sup> For by the death He died, He died to sin <font color='#7a8080'>[ending His relation to it]</font> once for all; and the life that He lives, He is living to God <font color='#7a8080'>[in unbroken fellowship with Him]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin <i>and</i> your relation to it broken, but alive to God <font color='#7a8080'>[living in unbroken fellowship with Him]</font> in Christ Jesus.

<p><sup>12</sup> Let not sin therefore rule as king in your mortal (short-lived, perishable) bodies, to make you yield to its cravings <i>and</i> be subject to its lusts <i>and</i> evil passions.

<p><sup>13</sup> Do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members <font color='#7a8080'>[and faculties]</font> to sin as instruments (tools) of wickedness. But offer <i>and</i> yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to <font color='#7a8080'>[perpetual]</font> life, and your bodily members <font color='#7a8080'>[and faculties]</font> to God, presenting them as implements of righteousness.

<p><sup>14</sup> For sin shall not <font color='#7a8080'>[any longer]</font> exert dominion over you, since now you are not under Law <font color='#7a8080'>[as slaves]</font>, but under grace <font color='#7a8080'>[as subjects of God's favor and mercy]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> What then <font color='#7a8080'>[are we to conclude]</font>? Shall we sin because we live not under Law but under God's favor <i>and</i> mercy? Certainly not!

<p><sup>16</sup> Do you not know that if you continually surrender yourselves to anyone to do his will, you are the slaves of him whom you obey, whether that be to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience which leads to righteousness (right doing and right standing with God)?

<p><sup>17</sup> But thank God, though you were once slaves of sin, you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed <i>and</i> to which you were committed.

<p><sup>18</sup> And having been set free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness (of conformity to the divine will in thought, purpose, and action).

<p><sup>19</sup> I am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations. For as you yielded your bodily members <font color='#7a8080'>[and faculties]</font> as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness, so now yield your bodily members <font color='#7a8080'>[and faculties]</font> once for all as servants to righteousness (right being and doing) <font color='#7a8080'>[which leads]</font> to sanctification.

<p><sup>20</sup> For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.

<p><sup>21</sup> But then what benefit (return) did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? <font color='#7a8080'>[None]</font> for the end of those things is death.

<p><sup>22</sup> But now since you have been set free from sin and have become the slaves of God, you have your present reward in holiness and its end is eternal life.

<p><sup>23</sup> For the wages which sin pays is death, but the <font color='#7a8080'>[bountiful]</font> free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.

<h4>7</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Do you not know, brethren—for I am speaking to men who are acquainted with the Law—that legal claims have power over a person only for as long as he is alive?

<p><sup>2</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[instance]</font> a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is loosed <i>and</i> discharged from the law concerning her husband.

<p><sup>3</sup> Accordingly, she will be held an adulteress if she unites herself to another man while her husband lives. But if her husband dies, the marriage law no longer is binding on her <font color='#7a8080'>[she is free from that law]</font>; and if she unites herself to another man, she is not an adulteress.

<p><sup>4</sup> Likewise, my brethren, you have undergone death as to the Law through the <font color='#7a8080'>[crucified]</font> body of Christ, so that now you may belong to Another, to Him Who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.

<p><sup>5</sup> When we were living in the flesh (mere physical lives), the sinful passions that were awakened <i>and</i> aroused up by <font color='#7a8080'>[what]</font> the Law <font color='#7a8080'>[makes sin]</font> were constantly operating in our natural powers (in our bodily organs, in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh), so that we bore fruit for death.

<p><sup>6</sup> But now we are discharged from the Law <i>and</i> have terminated all intercourse with it, having died to what once restrained <i>and</i> held us captive. So now we serve not under <font color='#7a8080'>[obedience to]</font> the old code of written regulations, but <font color='#7a8080'>[under obedience to the promptings]</font> of the Spirit in newness <font color='#7a8080'>[of life]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> What then do we conclude? Is the Law identical with sin? Certainly not! Nevertheless, if it had not been for the Law, I should not have recognized sin <i>or</i> have known its meaning. <font color='#7a8080'>[For instance]</font> I would not have known about covetousness <font color='#7a8080'>[would have had no consciousness of sin or sense of guilt]</font> if the Law had not <font color='#7a8080'>[repeatedly]</font> said, You shall not covet <i>and</i> have an evil desire <font color='#7a8080'>[for one thing and another]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment <font color='#7a8080'>[to express itself]</font>, got a hold on me <i>and</i> aroused <i>and</i> stimulated all kinds of forbidden desires (lust, covetousness). For without the Law sin is dead <font color='#7a8080'>[the sense of it is inactive and a lifeless thing]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> Once I was alive, but quite apart from <i>and</i> unconscious of the Law. But when the commandment came, sin lived again and I died (was sentenced by the Law to death).

<p><sup>10</sup> And the very legal ordinance which was designed <i>and</i> intended to bring life actually proved <font color='#7a8080'>[to mean to me]</font> death.

<p><sup>11</sup> For sin, seizing the opportunity <i>and</i> getting a hold on me <font color='#7a8080'>[by taking its incentive]</font> from the commandment, beguiled <i>and</i> entrapped <i>and</i> cheated me, and using it <font color='#7a8080'>[as a weapon]</font>, killed me.

<p><sup>12</sup> The Law therefore is holy, and <font color='#7a8080'>[each]</font> commandment is holy and just and good.

<p><sup>13</sup> Did that which is good then prove fatal <font color='#7a8080'>[bringing death]</font> to me? Certainly not! It was sin, working death in me by using this good thing <font color='#7a8080'>[as a weapon]</font>, in order that through the commandment sin might be shown up clearly to be sin, that the extreme malignity and immeasurable sinfulness of sin might plainly appear.

<p><sup>14</sup> We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am a creature of the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[carnal, unspiritual]</font>, having been sold into slavery under <font color='#7a8080'>[the control of]</font> sin.

<p><sup>15</sup> For I do not understand my own actions <font color='#7a8080'>[I am baffled, bewildered]</font>. I do not practice <i>or</i> accomplish what I wish, but I do the very thing that I loathe <font color='#7a8080'>[which my moral instinct condemns]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> Now if I do <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> what is contrary to my desire, <font color='#7a8080'>[that means that]</font> I acknowledge <i>and</i> agree that the Law is good (morally excellent) <i>and</i> that I take sides with it.

<p><sup>17</sup> However, it is no longer I who do the deed, but the sin <font color='#7a8080'>[principle]</font> which is at home in me <i>and</i> has possession of me.

<p><sup>18</sup> For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot perform it. <font color='#7a8080'>[I have the intention and urge to do what is right, but no power to carry it out.]</font>

<p><sup>19</sup> For I fail to practice the good deeds I desire to do, but the evil deeds that I do not desire to do are what I am <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> doing.

<p><sup>20</sup> Now if I do what I do not desire to do, it is no longer I doing it <font color='#7a8080'>[it is not myself that acts]</font>, but the sin <font color='#7a8080'>[principle]</font> which dwells within me <font color='#7a8080'>[fixed and operating in my soul]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> So I find it to be a law (rule of action of my being) that when I want to do what is right <i>and</i> good, evil is ever present with me <i>and</i> I am subject to its insistent demands.

<p><sup>22</sup> For I endorse <i>and</i> delight in the Law of God in my inmost self <font color='#7a8080'>[with my new nature]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> But I discern in my bodily members <font color='#7a8080'>[in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh]</font> a different law (rule of action) at war against the law of my mind (my reason) and making me a prisoner to the law of sin that dwells in my bodily organs <font color='#7a8080'>[in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> O unhappy <i>and</i> pitiable <i>and</i> wretched man that I am! Who will release <i>and</i> deliver me from <font color='#7a8080'>[the shackles of]</font> this body of death?

<p><sup>25</sup> O thank God! <font color='#7a8080'>[He will!]</font> through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) our Lord! So then indeed I, of myself with the mind <i>and</i> heart, serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.

<h4>8</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, <font color='#7a8080'>[there is]</font> now no condemnation (no adjudging guilty of wrong) for those who are in Christ Jesus, <i>who live <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> walk not after the dictates of the flesh, but after the dictates of the Spirit</i>.

<p><sup>2</sup> For the law of the Spirit of life <font color='#7a8080'>[which is]</font> in Christ Jesus <font color='#7a8080'>[the law of our new being]</font> has freed me from the law of sin and of death.

<p><sup>3</sup> For God has done what the Law could not do, <font color='#7a8080'>[its power]</font> being weakened by the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[the entire nature of man without the Holy Spirit]</font>. Sending His own Son in the guise of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> condemned sin in the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[subdued, overcame, deprived it of its power over all who accept that sacrifice]</font>,

<p><sup>4</sup> So that the righteous <i>and</i> just requirement of the Law might be fully met in us who live <i>and</i> move not in the ways of the flesh but in the ways of the Spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[our lives governed not by the standards and according to the dictates of the flesh, but controlled by the Holy Spirit]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> For those who are according to the flesh <i>and</i> are controlled by its unholy desires set their minds on <i>and</i> pursue those things which gratify the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit <i>and</i> are controlled by the desires of the Spirit set their minds on <i>and</i> seek those things which gratify the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit.

<p><sup>6</sup> Now the mind of the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[which is sense and reason without the Holy Spirit]</font> is death <font color='#7a8080'>[death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin, both here and hereafter]</font>. But the mind of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit is life and <font color='#7a8080'>[soul]</font> peace <font color='#7a8080'>[both now and forever]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[That is]</font> because the mind of the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[with its carnal thoughts and purposes]</font> is hostile to God, for it does not submit itself to God's Law; indeed it cannot.

<p><sup>8</sup> So then those who are living the life of the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature]</font> cannot please <i>or</i> satisfy God, <i>or</i> be acceptable to Him.

<p><sup>9</sup> But you are not living the life of the flesh, you are living the life of the Spirit, if the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit of God <font color='#7a8080'>[really]</font> dwells within you <font color='#7a8080'>[directs and controls you]</font>. But if anyone does not possess the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit of Christ, he is none of His <font color='#7a8080'>[he does not belong to Christ, is not truly a child of God]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> But if Christ lives in you, <font color='#7a8080'>[then although]</font> your <font color='#7a8080'>[natural]</font> body is dead by reason of sin <i>and</i> guilt, the spirit is alive because of <font color='#7a8080'>[the]</font> righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[that He imputes to you]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> He Who raised up Christ <i>Jesus</i> from the dead will also restore to life your mortal (short-lived, perishable) bodies through His Spirit Who dwells in you.

<p><sup>12</sup> So then, brethren, we are debtors, but not to the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[we are not obligated to our carnal nature]</font>, to live <font color='#7a8080'>[a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates]</font> of the flesh.

<p><sup>13</sup> For if you live according to <font color='#7a8080'>[the dictates of]</font> the flesh, you will surely die. But if through the power of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit you are <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> putting to death (making extinct, deadening) the <font color='#7a8080'>[evil]</font> deeds prompted by the body, you shall <font color='#7a8080'>[really and genuinely]</font> live forever.

<p><sup>14</sup> For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.

<p><sup>15</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[the Spirit which]</font> you have now received <font color='#7a8080'>[is]</font> not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in bondage to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption <font color='#7a8080'>[the Spirit producing sonship]</font> in <font color='#7a8080'>[the bliss of]</font> which we cry, Abba (Father)! Father!

<p><sup>16</sup> The Spirit Himself <font color='#7a8080'>[thus]</font> testifies together with our own spirit, <font color='#7a8080'>[assuring us]</font> that we are children of God.

<p><sup>17</sup> And if we are <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> children, then we are <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ <font color='#7a8080'>[sharing His inheritance with Him]</font>; only we must share His suffering if we are to share His glory.

<p><sup>18</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[But what of that?]</font> For I consider that the sufferings of this present time (this present life) are not worth being compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us <i>and</i> in us <i>and</i> for us <i>and</i> conferred on us!

<p><sup>19</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[even the whole]</font> creation (all nature) waits expectantly <i>and</i> longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known <font color='#7a8080'>[waits for the revealing, the disclosing of their sonship]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> For the creation (nature) was subjected to frailty (to futility, condemned to frustration), not because of some intentional fault on its part, but by the will of Him Who so subjected it—<font color='#7a8080'>[yet]</font> with the hope

<p><sup>21</sup> That nature (creation) itself will be set free from its bondage to decay <i>and</i> corruption <font color='#7a8080'>[and gain an entrance]</font> into the glorious freedom of God's children.

<p><sup>22</sup> We know that the whole creation <font color='#7a8080'>[of irrational creatures]</font> has been moaning together in the pains of labor until now.

<p><sup>23</sup> And not only the creation, but we ourselves too, who have <i>and</i> enjoy the firstfruits of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[a foretaste of the blissful things to come]</font> groan inwardly as we wait for the redemption of our bodies <font color='#7a8080'>[from sensuality and the grave, which will reveal]</font> our adoption (our manifestation as God's sons).

<p><sup>24</sup> For in <font color='#7a8080'>[this]</font> hope we were saved. But hope <font color='#7a8080'>[the object of]</font> which is seen is not hope. For how can one hope for what he already sees?

<p><sup>25</sup> But if we hope for what is still unseen by us, we wait for it with patience <i>and</i> composure.

<p><sup>26</sup> So too the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit comes to our aid <i>and</i> bears us up in our weakness; for we do not know what prayer to offer <i>nor</i> how to offer it worthily as we ought, but the Spirit Himself goes to meet our supplication <i>and</i> pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings <i>and</i> groanings too deep for utterance.

<p><sup>27</sup> And He Who searches the hearts of men knows what is in the mind of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[what His intent is]</font>, because the Spirit intercedes <i>and</i> pleads <font color='#7a8080'>[before God]</font> in behalf of the saints according to <i>and</i> in harmony with God's will.

<p><sup>28</sup> We are assured <i>and</i> know that <font color='#7a8080'>[God being a partner in their labor]</font> all things work together <i>and</i> are <font color='#7a8080'>[fitting into a plan]</font> for good to <i>and</i> for those who love God and are called according to <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> design <i>and</i> purpose.

<p><sup>29</sup> For those whom He foreknew <font color='#7a8080'>[of whom He was aware and loved beforehand]</font>, He also destined from the beginning <font color='#7a8080'>[foreordaining them]</font> to be molded into the image of His Son <font color='#7a8080'>[and share inwardly His likeness]</font>, that He might become the firstborn among many brethren.

<p><sup>30</sup> And those whom He thus foreordained, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified (acquitted, made righteous, putting them into right standing with Himself). And those whom He justified, He also glorified <font color='#7a8080'>[raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being]</font>.

<p><sup>31</sup> What then shall we say to <font color='#7a8080'>[all]</font> this? If God is for us, who <font color='#7a8080'>[can be]</font> against us? <font color='#7a8080'>[Who can be our foe, if God is on our side?]</font>

<p><sup>32</sup> He who did not withhold <i>or</i> spare <font color='#7a8080'>[even]</font> His own Son but gave Him up for us all, will He not also with Him freely <i>and</i> graciously give us all <font color='#7a8080'>[other]</font> things?

<p><sup>33</sup> Who shall bring any charge against God's elect <font color='#7a8080'>[when it is]</font> God Who justifies <font color='#7a8080'>[that is, Who puts us in right relation to Himself? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen? Will God, Who acquits us?]</font>

<p><sup>34</sup> Who is there to condemn <font color='#7a8080'>[us]</font>? Will Christ Jesus (the Messiah), Who died, or rather Who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading <i>as</i> He intercedes for us?

<p><sup>35</sup> Who shall ever separate us from Christ's love? Shall suffering <i>and</i> affliction <i>and</i> tribulation? Or calamity <i>and</i> distress? Or persecution or hunger or destitution or peril or sword?

<p><sup>36</sup> Even as it is written, For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we are regarded <i>and</i> counted as sheep for the slaughter.

<p><sup>37</sup> Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors <i>and</i> gain a surpassing victory through Him Who loved us.

<p><sup>38</sup> For I am persuaded beyond doubt (am sure) that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things impending <i>and</i> threatening nor things to come, nor powers,

<p><sup>39</sup> Nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<h4>9</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> I am speaking the truth in Christ. I am not lying; my conscience <font color='#7a8080'>[enlightened and prompted]</font> by the Holy Spirit bearing witness with me

<p><sup>2</sup> That I have bitter grief and incessant anguish in my heart.

<p><sup>3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were accursed <i>and</i> cut off <i>and</i> banished from Christ for the sake of my brethren <i>and</i> instead of them, my natural kinsmen <i>and</i> my fellow countrymen.

<p><sup>4</sup> For they are Israelites, and to them belong God's adoption <font color='#7a8080'>[as a nation]</font> and the glorious Presence (Shekinah). With them were the special covenants made, to them was the Law given. To them <font color='#7a8080'>[the temple]</font> worship was revealed and <font color='#7a8080'>[God's own]</font> promises announced.

<p><sup>5</sup> To them belong the patriarchs, and as far as His natural descent was concerned, from them is the Christ, Who is exalted <i>and</i> supreme over all, God, blessed forever! Amen (so let it be).

<p><sup>6</sup> However, it is not as though God's Word had failed <font color='#7a8080'>[coming to nothing]</font>. For it is not everybody who is a descendant of Jacob (Israel) who belongs to <font color='#7a8080'>[the true]</font> Israel.

<p><sup>7</sup> And they are not all the children of Abraham because they are by blood his descendants. No, <font color='#7a8080'>[the promise was]</font> Your descendants will be called <i>and</i> counted through the line of Isaac <font color='#7a8080'>[though Abraham had an older son]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> That is to say, it is not the children of the body <font color='#7a8080'>[of Abraham]</font> who are made God's children, but it is the offspring to whom the promise applies that shall be counted <font color='#7a8080'>[as Abraham's true]</font> descendants.

<p><sup>9</sup> For this is what the promise said, About this time <font color='#7a8080'>[next year]</font> will I return and Sarah shall have a son.

<p><sup>10</sup> And not only that, but this too: Rebecca conceived <font color='#7a8080'>[two sons under exactly the same circumstances]</font> by our forefather Isaac,

<p><sup>11</sup> And the children were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil. Even so, in order further to carry out God's purpose of selection (election, choice), which depends not on works <i>or</i> what men can do, but on Him Who calls <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font>,

<p><sup>12</sup> It was said to her that the elder <font color='#7a8080'>[son]</font> should serve the younger <font color='#7a8080'>[son]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated (held in relative disregard in comparison with My feeling for Jacob).

<p><sup>14</sup> What shall we conclude then? Is there injustice upon God's part? Certainly not!

<p><sup>15</sup> For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion (pity) on whom I will have compassion.

<p><sup>16</sup> So then <font color='#7a8080'>[God's gift]</font> is not a question of human will and human effort, but of God's mercy. <font color='#7a8080'>[It depends not on one's own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race, but on God's having mercy on him.]</font>

<p><sup>17</sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, I have raised you up for this very purpose of displaying My power in <font color='#7a8080'>[dealing with]</font> you, so that My name may be proclaimed the whole world over.

<p><sup>18</sup> So then He has mercy on whomever He wills (chooses) and He hardens (makes stubborn and unyielding the heart of) whomever He wills.

<p><sup>19</sup> You will say to me, Why then does He still find fault <i>and</i> blame us <font color='#7a8080'>[for sinning]</font>? For who can resist <i>and</i> withstand His will?

<p><sup>20</sup> But who are you, a mere man, to criticize <i>and</i> contradict <i>and</i> answer back to God? Will what is formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?

<p><sup>21</sup> Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same mass (lump) one vessel for beauty <i>and</i> distinction <i>and</i> honorable use, and another for menial <i>or</i> ignoble <i>and</i> dishonorable use?

<p><sup>22</sup> What if God, although fully intending to show <font color='#7a8080'>[the awfulness of]</font> His wrath and to make known His power <i>and</i> authority, has tolerated with much patience the vessels (objects) of <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> anger which are ripe for destruction?

<p><sup>23</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[what if]</font> He thus purposes to make known <i>and</i> show the wealth of His glory in <font color='#7a8080'>[dealing with]</font> the vessels (objects) of His mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory,

<p><sup>24</sup> Even including ourselves whom He has called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles (heathen)?

<p><sup>25</sup> Just as He says in Hosea, Those who were not My people I will call My people, and her who was not beloved <font color='#7a8080'>[I will call]</font> My beloved.

<p><sup>26</sup> And it shall be that in the very place where it was said to them, You are not My people, they shall be called sons of the living God.

<p><sup>27</sup> And Isaiah calls out (solemnly cries aloud) over Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, only the remnant (a small part of them) will be saved <font color='#7a8080'>[from perdition, condemnation, judgment]</font>!

<p><sup>28</sup> For the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth <font color='#7a8080'>[He will conclude and close His account with men completely and without delay]</font>, rigorously cutting it short in His justice.

<p><sup>29</sup> It is as Isaiah predicted, If the Lord of hosts had not left us a seed <font color='#7a8080'>[from which to propagate descendants]</font>, we <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font> would have fared like Sodom and have been made like Gomorrah.

<p><sup>30</sup> What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not follow after righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[who did not seek salvation by right relationship to God]</font> have attained it by faith <font color='#7a8080'>[a righteousness imputed by God, based on and produced by faith]</font>,

<p><sup>31</sup> Whereas Israel, though ever in pursuit of a law <font color='#7a8080'>[for the securing]</font> of righteousness (right standing with God), actually did not succeed in fulfilling the Law.

<p><sup>32</sup> For what reason? Because <font color='#7a8080'>[they pursued it]</font> not through faith, relying <font color='#7a8080'>[instead]</font> on the merit of their works <font color='#7a8080'>[they did not depend on faith but on what they could do]</font>. They have stumbled over the Stumbling Stone.

<p><sup>33</sup> As it is written, Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone that will make men stumble, a Rock that will make them fall; but he who believes in Him <font color='#7a8080'>[who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him]</font> shall not be put to shame <i>nor</i> be disappointed in his expectations.

<h4>10</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Brethren, <font color='#7a8080'>[with all]</font> my heart's desire <i>and</i> goodwill for <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel]</font>, I long and pray to God that they may be saved.

<p><sup>2</sup> I bear them witness that they have a <font color='#7a8080'>[certain]</font> zeal <i>and</i> enthusiasm for God, but it is not enlightened <i>and</i> according to <font color='#7a8080'>[correct and vital]</font> knowledge.

<p><sup>3</sup> For being ignorant of the righteousness that God ascribes <font color='#7a8080'>[which makes one acceptable to Him in word, thought, and deed]</font> and seeking to establish a <i>righteousness (a means of salvation)</i> of their own, they did not obey <i>or</i> submit themselves to God's righteousness.

<p><sup>4</sup> For Christ is the end of the Law <font color='#7a8080'>[the limit at which it ceases to be, for the Law leads up to Him Who is the fulfillment of its types, and in Him the purpose which it was designed to accomplish is fulfilled. That is, the purpose of the Law is fulfilled in Him]</font> as the means of righteousness (right relationship to God) for everyone who trusts in <i>and</i> adheres to <i>and</i> relies on Him.

<p><sup>5</sup> For Moses writes that the man who <font color='#7a8080'>[can]</font> practice the righteousness (perfect conformity to God's will) which is based on the Law <font color='#7a8080'>[with all its intricate demands]</font> shall live by it.

<p><sup>6</sup> But the righteousness based on faith <font color='#7a8080'>[imputed by God and bringing right relationship with Him]</font> says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into Heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;

<p><sup>7</sup> Or who will descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ up from the dead <font color='#7a8080'>[as if we could be saved by our own efforts]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> But what does it say? The Word (God's message in Christ) is near you, on your lips and in your heart; that is, the Word (the message, the basis and object) of faith which we preach,

<p><sup>9</sup> Because if you acknowledge <i>and</i> confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to, trust in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

<p><sup>10</sup> For with the heart a person believes (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Christ) and so is justified (declared righteous, acceptable to God), and with the mouth he confesses (declares openly and speaks out freely his faith) <i>and</i> confirms <font color='#7a8080'>[his]</font> salvation.

<p><sup>11</sup> The Scripture says, No man who believes in Him <font color='#7a8080'>[who adheres to, relies on, and trusts in Him]</font> will <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> be put to shame <i>or</i> be disappointed.

<p><sup>12</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[No one]</font> for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. The same Lord is Lord over all <font color='#7a8080'>[of us]</font> and He generously bestows His riches upon all who call upon Him <font color='#7a8080'>[in faith]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[invoking Him as Lord]</font> will be saved.

<p><sup>14</sup> But how are people to call upon Him Whom they have not believed <font color='#7a8080'>[in Whom they have no faith, on Whom they have no reliance]</font>? And how are they to believe in Him <font color='#7a8080'>[adhere to, trust in, and rely upon Him]</font> of Whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?

<p><sup>15</sup> And how can men <font color='#7a8080'>[be expected to]</font> preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings! <font color='#7a8080'>[How welcome is the coming of those who preach the good news of His good things!]</font>

<p><sup>16</sup> But they have not all heeded the Gospel; for Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed (had faith in) what he has heard from us?

<p><sup>17</sup> So faith comes by hearing <font color='#7a8080'>[what is told]</font>, and what is heard comes by the preaching <font color='#7a8080'>[of the message that came from the lips]</font> of Christ (the Messiah Himself).

<p><sup>18</sup> But I ask, Have they not heard? Indeed they have; <font color='#7a8080'>[for the Scripture says]</font> Their voice <font color='#7a8080'>[that of nature bearing God's message]</font> has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the far bounds of the world.

<p><sup>19</sup> Again I ask, Did Israel not understand? <font color='#7a8080'>[Did the Jews have no warning that the Gospel was to go forth to the Gentiles, to all the earth?]</font> First, there is Moses who says, I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry.

<p><sup>20</sup> Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, I have been found by those who did not seek Me; I have shown (revealed) Myself to those who did not <font color='#7a8080'>[consciously]</font> ask for Me.

<p><sup>21</sup> But of Israel he says, All day long I have stretched out My hands to a people unyielding <i>and</i> disobedient and self-willed <font color='#7a8080'>[to a faultfinding, contrary, and contradicting people]</font>.

<h4>11</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> I ask then: Has God totally rejected <i>and</i> disowned His people? Of course not! Why, I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin!

<p><sup>2</sup> No, God has not rejected <i>and</i> disowned His people <font color='#7a8080'>[whose destiny]</font> He had marked out <i>and</i> appointed <i>and</i> foreknown from the beginning. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?

<p><sup>3</sup> Lord, they have killed Your prophets; they have demolished Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.

<p><sup>4</sup> But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal!

<p><sup>5</sup> So too at the present time there is a remnant (a small believing minority), selected (chosen) by grace (by God's unmerited favor and graciousness).

<p><sup>6</sup> But if it is by grace (His unmerited favor and graciousness), it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace <font color='#7a8080'>[it would be meaningless]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> What then <font color='#7a8080'>[shall we conclude]</font>? Israel failed to obtain what it sought <font color='#7a8080'>[God's favor by obedience to the Law]</font>. Only the elect (those chosen few) obtained it, while the rest of them became callously indifferent (blinded, hardened, and made insensible to it).

<p><sup>8</sup> As it is written, God gave them a spirit (an attitude) of stupor, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, <font color='#7a8080'>[that has continued]</font> down to this very day.

<p><sup>9</sup> And David says, Let their table (their feasting, banqueting) become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a just retribution <font color='#7a8080'>[rebounding like a boomerang upon them]</font>;

<p><sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened (dimmed) so that they cannot see, and make them bend their back <font color='#7a8080'>[stooping beneath their burden]</font> forever.

<p><sup>11</sup> So I ask, Have they stumbled so as to fall <font color='#7a8080'>[to their utter spiritual ruin, irretrievably]</font>? By no means! But through their false step <i>and</i> transgression salvation <font color='#7a8080'>[has come]</font> to the Gentiles, so as to arouse Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[to see and feel what they forfeited]</font> and so to make them jealous.

<p><sup>12</sup> Now if their stumbling (their lapse, their transgression) has so enriched the world <font color='#7a8080'>[at large]</font>, and if <font color='#7a8080'>[Israel's]</font> failure means such riches for the Gentiles, think what an enrichment <i>and</i> greater advantage will follow their full reinstatement!

<p><sup>13</sup> But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I lay great stress on my ministry <i>and</i> magnify my office,

<p><sup>14</sup> In the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous <font color='#7a8080'>[in order to stir them up to imitate, copy, and appropriate]</font>, and thus managing to save some of them.

<p><sup>15</sup> For if their rejection <i>and</i> exclusion from the benefits of salvation were <font color='#7a8080'>[overruled]</font> for the reconciliation of a world to God, what will their acceptance <i>and</i> admission mean? <font color='#7a8080'>[It will be nothing short of]</font> life from the dead!

<p><sup>16</sup> Now if the first handful of dough offered as the firstfruits <font color='#7a8080'>[Abraham and the patriarchs]</font> is consecrated (holy), so is the whole mass <font color='#7a8080'>[the nation of Israel]</font>; and if the root <font color='#7a8080'>[Abraham]</font> is consecrated (holy), so are the branches.

<p><sup>17</sup> But if some of the branches were broken off, while you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them to share the richness <font color='#7a8080'>[of the root and sap]</font> of the olive tree,

<p><sup>18</sup> Do not boast over the branches <i>and</i> pride yourself at their expense. If you do boast <i>and</i> feel superior, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root <font color='#7a8080'>[that supports]</font> you.

<p><sup>19</sup> You will say then, Branches were broken (pruned) off so that I might be grafted in!

<p><sup>20</sup> That is true. But they were broken (pruned) off because of their unbelief (their lack of real faith), and you are established through faith <font color='#7a8080'>[because you do believe]</font>. So do not become proud <i>and</i> conceited, but rather stand in awe <i>and</i> be reverently afraid.

<p><sup>21</sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches <font color='#7a8080'>[because of unbelief]</font>, neither will He spare you <font color='#7a8080'>[if you are guilty of the same offense]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> Then note <i>and</i> appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's gracious kindness to you—provided you continue in His grace <i>and</i> abide in His kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off (pruned away).

<p><sup>23</sup> And even those others <font color='#7a8080'>[the fallen branches, Jews]</font>, if they do not persist in <font color='#7a8080'>[clinging to]</font> their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.

<p><sup>24</sup> For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and against nature grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier will it be to graft these natural <font color='#7a8080'>[branches]</font> back on <font color='#7a8080'>[the original parent stock of]</font> their own olive tree.

<p><sup>25</sup> Lest you be self-opinionated (wise in your own conceits), I do not want you to miss this hidden truth <i>and</i> mystery, brethren: a hardening (insensibility) has <font color='#7a8080'>[temporarily]</font> befallen a part of Israel <font color='#7a8080'>[to last]</font> until the full number of the ingathering of the Gentiles has come in,

<p><sup>26</sup> And so all Israel will be saved. As it is written, The Deliverer will come from Zion, He will banish ungodliness from Jacob.

<p><sup>27</sup> And this will be My covenant (My agreement) with them when I shall take away their sins.

<p><sup>28</sup> From the point of view of the Gospel (good news), they <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jews, at present]</font> are enemies <font color='#7a8080'>[of God]</font>, which is for your advantage <i>and</i> benefit. But from the point of view of God's choice (of election, of divine selection), they are still the beloved (dear to Him) for the sake of their forefathers.

<p><sup>29</sup> For God's gifts and His call are irrevocable. <font color='#7a8080'>[He never withdraws them when once they are given, and He does not change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call.]</font>

<p><sup>30</sup> Just as you were once disobedient <i>and</i> rebellious toward God but now have obtained <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> mercy, through their disobedience,

<p><sup>31</sup> So they also now are being disobedient <font color='#7a8080'>[when you are receiving mercy]</font>, that they in turn may one day, through the mercy you are enjoying, also receive mercy <font color='#7a8080'>[that they may share the mercy which has been shown to you—through you as messengers of the Gospel to them]</font>.

<p><sup>32</sup> For God has consigned (penned up) all men to disobedience, only that He may have mercy on them all <font color='#7a8080'>[alike]</font>.

<p><sup>33</sup> Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unfathomable (inscrutable, unsearchable) are His judgments (His decisions)! And how untraceable (mysterious, undiscoverable) are His ways (His methods, His paths)!

<p><sup>34</sup> For who has known the mind of the Lord <i>and</i> who has understood His thoughts, or who has <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> been His counselor?

<p><sup>35</sup> Or who has first given God anything that he might be paid back <i>or</i> that he could claim a recompense?

<p><sup>36</sup> For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. <font color='#7a8080'>[For all things originate with Him and come from Him; all things live through Him, and all things center in and tend to consummate and to end in Him.]</font> To Him be glory forever! Amen (so be it).

<h4>12</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> I appeal to you therefore, brethren, <i>and</i> beg of you in view of <font color='#7a8080'>[all]</font> the mercies of God, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies <font color='#7a8080'>[presenting all your members and faculties]</font> as a living sacrifice, holy (devoted, consecrated) and well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable (rational, intelligent) service <i>and</i> spiritual worship.

<p><sup>2</sup> Do not be conformed to this world (this age), <font color='#7a8080'>[fashioned after and adapted to its external, superficial customs]</font>, but be transformed (changed) by the <font color='#7a8080'>[entire]</font> renewal of your mind <font color='#7a8080'>[by its new ideals and its new attitude]</font>, so that you may prove <font color='#7a8080'>[for yourselves]</font> what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, <i>even</i> the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect <font color='#7a8080'>[in His sight for you]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> For by the grace (unmerited favor of God) given to me I warn everyone among you not to estimate <i>and</i> think of himself more highly than he ought <font color='#7a8080'>[not to have an exaggerated opinion of his own importance]</font>, but to rate his ability with sober judgment, each according to the degree of faith apportioned by God to him.

<p><sup>4</sup> For as in one physical body we have many parts (organs, members) and all of these parts do not have the same function <i>or</i> use,

<p><sup>5</sup> So we, numerous as we are, are one body in Christ (the Messiah) and individually we are parts one of another <font color='#7a8080'>[mutually dependent on one another]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> Having gifts (faculties, talents, qualities) that differ according to the grace given us, let us use them: <font color='#7a8080'>[He whose gift is]</font> prophecy, <font color='#7a8080'>[let him prophesy]</font> according to the proportion of his faith;

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[He whose gift is]</font> practical service, let him give himself to serving; he who teaches, to his teaching;

<p><sup>8</sup> He who exhorts (encourages), to his exhortation; he who contributes, let him do it in simplicity <i>and</i> liberality; he who gives aid <i>and</i> superintends, with zeal <i>and</i> singleness of mind; he who does acts of mercy, with genuine cheerfulness <i>and</i> joyful eagerness.

<p><sup>9</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Let your]</font> love be sincere (a real thing); hate what is evil <font color='#7a8080'>[loathe all ungodliness, turn in horror from wickedness]</font>, but hold fast to that which is good.

<p><sup>10</sup> Love one another with brotherly affection <font color='#7a8080'>[as members of one family]</font>, giving precedence <i>and</i> showing honor to one another.

<p><sup>11</sup> Never lag in zeal <i>and</i> in earnest endeavor; be aglow <i>and</i> burning with the Spirit, serving the Lord.

<p><sup>12</sup> Rejoice <i>and</i> exult in hope; be steadfast and patient in suffering <i>and</i> tribulation; be constant in prayer.

<p><sup>13</sup> Contribute to the needs of God's people <font color='#7a8080'>[sharing in the necessities of the saints]</font>; pursue the practice of hospitality.

<p><sup>14</sup> Bless those who persecute you <font color='#7a8080'>[who are cruel in their attitude toward you]</font>; bless and do not curse them.

<p><sup>15</sup> Rejoice with those who rejoice <font color='#7a8080'>[sharing others' joy]</font>, and weep with those who weep <font color='#7a8080'>[sharing others' grief]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty (snobbish, high-minded, exclusive), but readily adjust yourself to <font color='#7a8080'>[people, things]</font> <i>and</i> give yourselves to humble tasks. Never overestimate yourself <i>or</i> be wise in your own conceits.

<p><sup>17</sup> Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is honest <i>and</i> proper <i>and</i> noble <font color='#7a8080'>[aiming to be above reproach]</font> in the sight of everyone.

<p><sup>18</sup> If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.

<p><sup>19</sup> Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave the way open for <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay (requite), says the Lord.

<p><sup>20</sup> But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head.

<p><sup>21</sup> Do not let yourself be overcome by evil, but overcome (master) evil with good.

<h4>13</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Let every person be loyally subject to the governing (civil) authorities. For there is no authority except from God <font color='#7a8080'>[by His permission, His sanction]</font>, and those that exist do so by God's appointment.

<p><sup>2</sup> Therefore he who resists <i>and</i> sets himself up against the authorities resists what God has appointed <i>and</i> arranged <font color='#7a8080'>[in divine order]</font>. And those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves <font color='#7a8080'>[receiving the penalty due them]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> For civil authorities are not a terror to <font color='#7a8080'>[people of]</font> good conduct, but to <font color='#7a8080'>[those of]</font> bad behavior. Would you have no dread of him who is in authority? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval <i>and</i> commendation.

<p><sup>4</sup> For he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, <font color='#7a8080'>[you should dread him and]</font> be afraid, for he does not bear <i>and</i> wear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant to execute His wrath (punishment, vengeance) on the wrongdoer.

<p><sup>5</sup> Therefore one must be subject, not only to avoid God's wrath <i>and</i> escape punishment, but also as a matter of principle <i>and</i> for the sake of conscience.

<p><sup>6</sup> For this same reason you pay taxes, for <font color='#7a8080'>[the civil authorities]</font> are official servants under God, devoting themselves to attending to this very service.

<p><sup>7</sup> Render to all men their dues. <font color='#7a8080'>[Pay]</font> taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, and honor to whom honor is due.

<p><sup>8</sup> Keep out of debt <i>and</i> owe no man anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor <font color='#7a8080'>[who practices loving others]</font> has fulfilled the Law <font color='#7a8080'>[relating to one's fellowmen, meeting all its requirements]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> The commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet (have an evil desire), and any other commandment, are summed up in the single command, You shall love your neighbor as <font color='#7a8080'>[you do]</font> yourself.

<p><sup>10</sup> Love does no wrong to one's neighbor <font color='#7a8080'>[it never hurts anybody]</font>. Therefore love meets all the requirements <i>and</i> is the fulfilling of the Law.

<p><sup>11</sup> Besides this you know what <font color='#7a8080'>[a critical]</font> hour this is, how it is high time now for you to wake up out of your sleep (rouse to reality). For salvation (final deliverance) is nearer to us now than when we first believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Christ, the Messiah).

<p><sup>12</sup> The night is far gone and the day is almost here. Let us then drop (fling away) the works <i>and</i> deeds of darkness and put on the <font color='#7a8080'>[full]</font> armor of light.

<p><sup>13</sup> Let us live <i>and</i> conduct ourselves honorably <i>and</i> becomingly as in the <font color='#7a8080'>[open light of]</font> day, not in reveling (carousing) and drunkenness, not in immorality and debauchery (sensuality and licentiousness), not in quarreling and jealousy.

<p><sup>14</sup> But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah), and make no provision for <font color='#7a8080'>[indulging]</font> the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature]</font> to <font color='#7a8080'>[gratify its]</font> desires (lusts).

<h4>14</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> As for the man who is a weak believer, welcome him <font color='#7a8080'>[into your fellowship]</font>, but not to criticize his opinions <i>or</i> pass judgment on his scruples <i>or</i> perplex him with discussions.

<p><sup>2</sup> One <font color='#7a8080'>[man's faith permits him to]</font> believe he may eat anything, while a weaker one <font color='#7a8080'>[limits his]</font> eating to vegetables.

<p><sup>3</sup> Let not him who eats look down on <i>or</i> despise him who abstains, and let not him who abstains criticize <i>and</i> pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted <i>and</i> welcomed him.

<p><sup>4</sup> Who are you to pass judgment on <i>and</i> censure another's household servant? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he shall stand <i>and</i> be upheld, for the Master (the Lord) is mighty to support him <i>and</i> make him stand.

<p><sup>5</sup> One man esteems one day as better than another, while another man esteems all days alike <font color='#7a8080'>[sacred]</font>. Let everyone be fully convinced (satisfied) in his own mind.

<p><sup>6</sup> He who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. He also who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.

<p><sup>7</sup> None of us lives to himself <font color='#7a8080'>[but to the Lord]</font>, and none of us dies to himself <font color='#7a8080'>[but to the Lord, for]</font>

<p><sup>8</sup> If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or we die, we belong to the Lord.

<p><sup>9</sup> For Christ died and lived again for this very purpose, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.

<p><sup>10</sup> Why do you criticize <i>and</i> pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you look down upon <i>or</i> despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.

<p><sup>11</sup> For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God <font color='#7a8080'>[acknowledge Him to His honor and to His praise]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> And so each of us shall give an account of himself <font color='#7a8080'>[give an answer in reference to judgment]</font> to God.

<p><sup>13</sup> Then let us no more criticize <i>and</i> blame <i>and</i> pass judgment on one another, but rather decide <i>and</i> endeavor never to put a stumbling block <i>or</i> an obstacle or a hindrance in the way of a brother.

<p><sup>14</sup> I know and am convinced (persuaded) as one in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is <font color='#7a8080'>[forbidden as]</font> essentially unclean (defiled and unholy in itself). But <font color='#7a8080'>[none the less]</font> it is unclean (defiled and unholy) to anyone who thinks it is unclean.

<p><sup>15</sup> But if your brother is being pained <i>or</i> his feelings hurt <i>or</i> if he is being injured by what you eat, <font color='#7a8080'>[then]</font> you are no longer walking in love. <font color='#7a8080'>[You have ceased to be living and conducting yourself by the standard of love toward him.]</font> Do not let what you eat hurt <i>or</i> cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died!

<p><sup>16</sup> Do not therefore let what seems good to you be considered an evil thing <font color='#7a8080'>[by someone else]</font>. <font color='#7a8080'>[In other words, do not give occasion for others to criticize that which is justifiable for you.]</font>

<p><sup>17</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[After all]</font> the kingdom of God is not a matter of <font color='#7a8080'>[getting the]</font> food and drink <font color='#7a8080'>[one likes]</font>, but instead it is righteousness (that state which makes a person acceptable to God) and <font color='#7a8080'>[heart]</font> peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

<p><sup>18</sup> He who serves Christ in this way is acceptable <i>and</i> pleasing to God and is approved by men.

<p><sup>19</sup> So let us then definitely aim for <i>and</i> eagerly pursue what makes for harmony and for mutual upbuilding (edification and development) of one another.

<p><sup>20</sup> You must not, for the sake of food, undo <i>and</i> break down and destroy the work of God! Everything is indeed <font color='#7a8080'>[ceremonially]</font> clean <i>and</i> pure, but it is wrong for anyone to hurt the conscience of others <i>or</i> to make them fall by what he eats.

<p><sup>21</sup> The right thing is to eat no meat or drink no wine <font color='#7a8080'>[at all]</font>, or <font color='#7a8080'>[do anything else]</font> if it makes your brother stumble <i>or</i> hurts his conscience <i>or</i> offends or weakens him.

<p><sup>22</sup> Your personal convictions <font color='#7a8080'>[on such matters]</font>—exercise <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font> as in God's presence, keeping them to yourself <font color='#7a8080'>[striving only to know the truth and obey His will]</font>. Blessed (happy, to be envied) is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves <font color='#7a8080'>[who does not convict himself by what he chooses to do]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> But the man who has doubts (misgivings, an uneasy conscience) about eating, and then eats <font color='#7a8080'>[perhaps because of you]</font>, stands condemned <font color='#7a8080'>[before God]</font>, because he is not true to his convictions <i>and</i> he does not act from faith. For whatever does not originate <i>and</i> proceed from faith is sin <font color='#7a8080'>[whatever is done without a conviction of its approval by God is sinful]</font>.

<h4>15</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> We who are strong <font color='#7a8080'>[in our convictions and of robust faith]</font> ought to bear with the failings <i>and</i> the frailties <i>and</i> the tender scruples of the weak; <font color='#7a8080'>[we ought to help carry the doubts and qualms of others]</font> and not to please ourselves.

<p><sup>2</sup> Let each one of us make it a practice to please (make happy) his neighbor for his good <i>and</i> for his true welfare, to edify him <font color='#7a8080'>[to strengthen him and build him up spiritually]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> For Christ did not please Himself <font color='#7a8080'>[gave no thought to His own interests]</font>; but, as it is written, The reproaches <i>and</i> abuses of those who reproached <i>and</i> abused you fell on Me.

<p><sup>4</sup> For whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction, that by <font color='#7a8080'>[our steadfast and patient]</font> endurance and the encouragement <font color='#7a8080'>[drawn]</font> from the Scriptures we might hold fast to <i>and</i> cherish hope.

<p><sup>5</sup> Now may the God Who gives the power of patient endurance (steadfastness) and Who supplies encouragement, grant you to live in such mutual harmony <i>and</i> such full sympathy with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,

<p><sup>6</sup> That together you may <font color='#7a8080'>[unanimously]</font> with united hearts <i>and</i> one voice, praise and glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).

<p><sup>7</sup> Welcome <i>and</i> receive <font color='#7a8080'>[to your hearts]</font> one another, then, even as Christ has welcomed <i>and</i> received you, for the glory of God.

<p><sup>8</sup> For I tell you that Christ (the Messiah) became a servant <i>and</i> a minister to the circumcised (the Jews) in order to show God's truthfulness <i>and</i> honesty by confirming (verifying) the promises <font color='#7a8080'>[given]</font> to our fathers,

<p><sup>9</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[also in order]</font> that the Gentiles (nations) might glorify God for His mercy <font color='#7a8080'>[not covenanted]</font> to them. As it is written, Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to Your name.

<p><sup>10</sup> Again it is said, Rejoice (exult), O Gentiles, along with His <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> people;

<p><sup>11</sup> And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise Him!

<p><sup>12</sup> And further Isaiah says, There shall be a Sprout from the Root of Jesse, He Who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles hope.

<p><sup>13</sup> May the God of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing <font color='#7a8080'>[through the experience of your faith]</font> that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound <i>and</i> be overflowing (bubbling over) with hope.

<p><sup>14</sup> Personally I am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are rich in goodness, amply filled with all <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual]</font> knowledge and competent to admonish <i>and</i> counsel <i>and</i> instruct one another also.

<p><sup>15</sup> Still on some points I have written to you the more boldly <i>and</i> unreservedly by way of reminder. <font color='#7a8080'>[I have done so]</font> because of the grace (the unmerited favor) bestowed on me by God

<p><sup>16</sup> In making me a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I act in the priestly service of the Gospel (the good news) of God, in order that the sacrificial offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable <font color='#7a8080'>[to God]</font>, consecrated <i>and</i> made holy by the Holy Spirit.

<p><sup>17</sup> In Christ Jesus, then, I have legitimate reason to glory (exult) in my work for God <font color='#7a8080'>[in what through Christ Jesus I have accomplished concerning the things of God]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[of course]</font> I will not venture (presume) to speak thus of any work except what Christ has actually done through me <font color='#7a8080'>[as an instrument in His hands]</font> to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed,

<p><sup>19</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Even as my preaching has been accompanied]</font> with the power of signs and wonders, <font color='#7a8080'>[and all of it]</font> by the power of the Holy Spirit. <font color='#7a8080'>[The result is]</font> that starting from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel <font color='#7a8080'>[faithfully executing, accomplishing, carrying out to the full the good news]</font> of Christ (the Messiah) in its entirety.

<p><sup>20</sup> Thus my ambition has been to preach the Gospel, not where Christ's name has already been known, lest I build on another man's foundation;

<p><sup>21</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[instead I would act on the principle]</font> as it is written, They shall see who have never been told of Him, and they shall understand who have never heard <font color='#7a8080'>[of Him]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> This <font color='#7a8080'>[ambition]</font> is the reason why I have so frequently been hindered from coming to visit you.

<p><sup>23</sup> But now since I have no further opportunity for work in these regions, and since I have longed for enough years to come to you,

<p><sup>24</sup> I hope to see you in passing <font color='#7a8080'>[through Rome]</font> as I go <font color='#7a8080'>[on my intended trip]</font> to Spain, and to be aided on my journey there by you, after I have enjoyed your company for a little while.

<p><sup>25</sup> For the present, however, I am going to Jerusalem to bring aid (relief) for the saints (God's people there).

<p><sup>26</sup> For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the saints of Jerusalem.

<p><sup>27</sup> They were pleased to do it; and surely they are in debt to them, for if these Gentiles have come to share in their <font color='#7a8080'>[the Jerusalem Jews']</font> spiritual blessings, then they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.

<p><sup>28</sup> When therefore I have completed this mission and have delivered to them <font color='#7a8080'>[at Jerusalem]</font> what has been raised, I shall go on by way of you to Spain.

<p><sup>29</sup> And I know that when I do come to you, I shall come in the abundant blessing <i>of the Gospel</i> of Christ.

<p><sup>30</sup> I appeal to you <font color='#7a8080'>[I entreat you]</font>, brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love <font color='#7a8080'>[given by]</font> the Spirit, to unite with me in earnest wrestling in prayer to God in my behalf.

<p><sup>31</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Pray]</font> that I may be delivered (rescued) from the unbelievers in Judea and that my mission of relief to Jerusalem may be acceptable <i>and</i> graciously received by the saints (God's people there),

<p><sup>32</sup> So that by God's will I may subsequently come to you with joy (with a happy heart) and be refreshed <font color='#7a8080'>[by the interval of rest]</font> in your company.

<p><sup>33</sup> May <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> peace-giving God be with you all! Amen (so be it).

<h4>16</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now I introduce <i>and</i> commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae,

<p><sup>2</sup> That you may receive her in the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[with a Christian welcome]</font>, as saints (God's people) ought to receive one another. And help her in whatever matter she may require assistance from you, for she has been a helper of many including myself <font color='#7a8080'>[shielding us from suffering]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

<p><sup>4</sup> Who risked their lives <font color='#7a8080'>[endangering their very necks]</font> for my life. To them not only I but also all the churches among the Gentiles give thanks.

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Remember me]</font> also to the church <font color='#7a8080'>[that meets]</font> in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was a firstfruit (first convert) to Christ in Asia.

<p><sup>6</sup> Greet Mary, who has worked so hard among you.

<p><sup>7</sup> Remember me to Andronicus and Junias, my tribal kinsmen and once my fellow prisoners. They are men held in high esteem among the apostles, who also were in Christ before I was.

<p><sup>8</sup> Remember me to Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.

<p><sup>9</sup> Salute Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear Stachys.

<p><sup>10</sup> Greet Apelles, that one tried <i>and</i> approved in Christ (the Messiah). Remember me to those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.

<p><sup>11</sup> Greet my tribal kinsman Herodion, and those in the Lord who belong to the household of Narcissus.

<p><sup>12</sup> Salute those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet my dear Persis, who has worked so hard in the Lord.

<p><sup>13</sup> Remember me to Rufus, eminent in the Lord, also to his mother <font color='#7a8080'>[who has been]</font> a mother to me as well.

<p><sup>14</sup> Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them.

<p><sup>15</sup> Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.

<p><sup>16</sup> Greet one another with a holy (consecrated) kiss. All the churches of Christ (the Messiah) wish to be remembered to you.

<p><sup>17</sup> I appeal to you, brethren, to be on your guard concerning those who create dissensions and difficulties <i>and</i> cause divisions, in opposition to the doctrine (the teaching) which you have been taught. <font color='#7a8080'>[I warn you to turn aside from them, to]</font> avoid them.

<p><sup>18</sup> For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites <i>and</i> base desires, and by ingratiating and flattering speech, they beguile the hearts of the unsuspecting <i>and</i> simpleminded <font color='#7a8080'>[people]</font>.

<p><sup>19</sup> For while your loyalty <i>and</i> obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, I would have you well versed <i>and</i> wise as to what is good and innocent <i>and</i> guileless as to what is evil.

<p><sup>20</sup> And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you.

<p><sup>21</sup> Timothy, my fellow worker, wishes to be remembered to you, as do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my tribal kinsmen.

<p><sup>22</sup> I, Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in the Lord.

<p><sup>23</sup> Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church here, greets you. So do Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus.

<p><sup>24</sup> <i>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it).</i>

<p><sup>25</sup> Now to Him Who is able to strengthen you in the faith which is in accordance with my Gospel and the preaching of (concerning) Jesus Christ (the Messiah), according to the revelation (the unveiling) of the mystery of the plan of redemption which was kept in silence <i>and</i> secret for long ages,

<p><sup>26</sup> But is now disclosed and through the prophetic Scriptures is made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, <font color='#7a8080'>[to win them]</font> to obedience to the faith,

<p><sup>27</sup> To <font color='#7a8080'>[the]</font> only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One)! Amen (so be it).
