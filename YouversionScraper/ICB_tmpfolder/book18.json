Can you search the limits of the God All-Powerful? They are deeper than where the dead are. You cannot know them! and wider than the sea. If he calls you into court, no one can stop him. And when he sees evil, he notices it. That is as impossible as a wild donkey being born tame. You must hold out your hands to him for help. Let no evil live in your tent. You can stand strong without fear. You will remember your troubles only as water that has passed by. And darkness will seem like morning. You will look around and rest in safety. Many people will want favor from you. So they will not be able to find the way to escape. Their only hope will be to die.&apos;"

He thinks, &quot;No one will see me.&quot; And he keeps his face covered. But in the daytime they shut themselves up in their own houses. They want nothing to do with the light. They make friends with the terrors of darkness. Their part of the land is cursed. No one uses the road that goes by their vineyards. In the same way, the place for the dead quickly takes away those who have sinned. The worms will eat his body. He will no longer be remembered. So wickedness is broken in pieces like a stick. And they show no kindness to widows. But even though they seem strong, they do not know how long they will live. But he is watching their ways. They are made unimportant and gathered up like everyone else. They are cut off like the tops of stalks of grain. And who can show that my words are worth nothing?&apos;"

God All-Powerful will never twist what is right. No one put him in charge of the whole world. to take away his spirit and breath. And they would all turn back into dust. Listen to what I have to say. How can you blame God who is both fair and powerful? And he says to important people, &quot;You are evil.&quot; He is not better to rich people than poor people. This is because he made them all with his own hands. The rich are struck down, and then they pass away. Powerful people die without man&quot;s help. He sees every step they take. where those who do evil can hide from God. He does not need for men to come before him for judging. And he puts other people in their place. He defeats them in the night, and they are crushed. He does it so that everyone else can watch. They did not care about any of his ways. He hears the cry of the needy. If he hides his face, no one can see him. But God still rules over both men and nations. And he keeps them from trapping others. &quot;I am guilty, but I will not sin anymore. If I have done wrong, I will not do it again.&quot; when you will not change your heart and life? You must decide, not I. So tell me what you know.
