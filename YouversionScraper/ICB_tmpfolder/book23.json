And a donkey knows where its owner feeds it. But the people of Israel do not know me. My people do not understand.&apos; The people are loaded down with guilt. They are like a group of children doing evil. They are full of evil. They have left the Lord. They hate God, the Holy One of Israel. They have turned away from him. Why do you continue to turn against him? Your whole head is hurt. And your whole heart is sick. from the bottom of your foot to the top of your head. You are covered with wounds, hurts and open sores. Your wounds are not cleaned and covered. No medicine takes away the pain. Your cities have been burned with fire. While you watch, your enemies are stealing everything from your land. Your land is ruined like a country destroyed by enemies. like an empty shelter in a vineyard. It is like a hut left in a field of melons. It is like a city surrounded by enemies. allowed a few of our people to live. Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Your people are like those of Gomorrah. Hear the word of the Lord. Listen to the teachings of our God! &apos;I do not want all these sacrifices you give me. I have had enough of your sacrifices of male sheep and fat from fine animals. I am not pleased by the blood of bulls, sheep and goats. But who asked you to do all this running in and out? I hate the incense you burn. I can&quot;t stand your New Moons, Sabbaths and other feast days. I can&quot;t stand the evil you do in holding your holy meetings. and your other yearly feasts. They have become like heavy weights on me. I am tired of carrying them. But I will refuse to look at you. Even if you say many prayers, I will not listen to you. It&quot;s because your hands are full of blood. Stop doing the evil things I see you do. Stop doing wrong! Be fair to other people. Punish those who hurt others. Help the orphans. Stand up for the rights of widows.&apos; &apos;Come, we will talk these things over. Your sins are red like deep red cloth. But they can be as white as snow. Your sins are bright red. But you can be white like wool. you will eat good crops from the land. you will be destroyed by your enemies&quot; swords.&apos; The Lord himself said these things. But she is no longer loyal to the Lord. She used to be filled with fairness. People there lived the way God wanted. But now, murderers live there. You are like wine mixed with water. They are friends of thieves. They all accept money for doing wrong things. They are paid to cheat people. They don&quot;t try to help the orphans. And they don&quot;t listen to the widows&quot; needs. the Mighty One of Israel, says: &apos;You, my enemies, will not cause me any more trouble. I will pay you back for what you did. I will clean away all your wrongs as if with soap. I will take all the worthless things out of you. Your counselors will be like the ones you had in the beginning. Then you will be called the City That Is Right with God. You will be called the Loyal City.&apos; he will rescue Jerusalem. Because the Lord does what is right, he will save her people who come back to him. Those who have left the Lord will die. because you have worshiped false gods under the oak trees. You will be disgraced because you have worshiped idols in your gardens. You will be like a garden without water. And what they do will be like sparks. The people and what they do will burn together. And no one will be able to stop that fire.&apos;"

I will break down the stone wall, and it will be walked on. It will not be trimmed or hoed. Weeds and thorns will grow there.

Even the mountains are frightened. Dead bodies lie in the streets like garbage. But the Lord is still angry. His hand is still raised to strike down the people. He is whistling to call those people. The enemy comes quickly! Not one of them gets sleepy and falls asleep. Their weapons are close at hand. Their sandal straps are not broken. All of their bows are ready to shoot. The horses&quot; hooves are hard as rock. Their chariot wheels move like a whirlwind. It is loud like a young lion. The enemy growls as they grab their captives. There is no one to stop them from taking their captives away. like the waves of the sea. And when people look at the land, they will see only darkness and pain.

The Lord is the God who lives forever. He created all the world. He does not become tired or need to rest. No one can understand how great his wisdom is. He gives more power to those who are weak.

Then we will believe that you are gods. Do something, whether it is good or bad. Make us afraid of you. You can&quot;t do anything. Those who worship you should be hated.&apos; I have called by name a man from the east, and he knows me. He walks on kings as if they were mud. He walks on them as a potter walks on the clay. Who told us ahead of time so we could say, &quot;He was right&quot;? None of you told us anything. None of you told us before it happened. No one heard you tell about it.

I, the Holy One of Israel, am your Savior. I gave Egypt to pay for you. I gave Cush and Seba to make you mine. I give you honor, and I love you. So I will give other people in your place. I will give other nations to save your life. I will gather your children from the east. I will gather you from the west. I will tell the south: Don&quot;t keep my people in prison. Bring my sons from far away. Bring my daughters from faraway places. I made them for my glory. I formed them; I made them.&apos; Bring out those who have ears but don&quot;t hear. All the people should come together. Which of their gods said that this would happen? Which of their gods can tell what happened in the beginning? They should bring their witnesses to prove they were right. Then others will say, &apos;It is true.&apos; You are the servant I chose. I chose you so you would know and believe me. I chose you so you would understand that I am the true God. There was no God before me, and there will be no God after me. I am the only Savior. It was not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses, and I am God,&apos; says the Lord. No one can save people from my power. When I do something, no one can change it.&apos; He is the Holy One of Israel who saves you. He says, &apos;I will send armies to Babylon for you. All the Babylonians will be captured. They will be taken away in their ships they are proud of. I made Israel. I am your king.&apos; He is the one who made a road through the sea. Even through rough waters he made a path for his people. He defeated the mighty armies. They fell together, and they will never rise again. They were destroyed as a flame is put out. Do not think about the past. It is already happening. Don&quot;t you see it? I will make a road in the desert. I will make rivers in the dry land. The wild dogs and owls will honor me. They will honor me when I put water in the desert. They will honor me when I make rivers in the dry land. I will do this to give water to my people, the ones I chose. And they will sing songs to praise me. People of Israel, you have become tired of me. You have not honored me by bringing sacrifices to me. I did not force you to give sacrifices to me. I did not force you to burn incense until you became tired. You did not freely bring fat from your sacrifices to me. Instead you have weighed me down with your many sins. You have made me tired of your many wrongs. I do this to please myself. I will not remember your sins. Let&quot;s meet and decide what is right. Tell what you have done and show you are right. And your leaders have turned against me. And I will bring destruction on the people of Jacob. And I will let Israel be insulted.&apos;"

You will be as proud of them as a bride is of her jewels. Your land was made useless. But now you will have more people than the land can hold. And those people who destroyed you will be far away. But they will say to you, &quot;This place is too small for us. Give us a bigger place to live.&quot; &quot;Who gave me all these children? I was sad and lonely. I was defeated and away from my people. So who reared these children? I was left all alone. Where did all these children come from?&quot;&apos; &apos;See, I will lift my hand to signal the nations. I will raise my banner for all people to see. Then they will bring your sons back to you in their arms. They will carry your daughters on their shoulders. Daughters of kings will take care of those children. They will bow down before you. They will kiss the dirt at your feet. Then you will know I am the Lord. Anyone who trusts in me will not be disappointed.&apos; Can a prisoner be freed from a powerful soldier? &apos;The prisoners will be taken from the strong soldiers. What the soldiers have taken will be saved. I will fight your enemies. I will save your children. Their own blood will be the wine that makes them drunk. Then everyone will know I, the Lord, am the One who saves you. I am the Powerful One of Jacob who saves you.&apos;"

I hate stealing and everything that is wrong. I will be fair and give my people what they should have. I will make an agreement with them that will continue forever. And their children will be known among the nations. Anyone who sees them will know that the Lord blesses them.&apos; All that I am rejoices in my God. The Lord has covered me with clothes of salvation. He has covered me with a coat of goodness. I am like a bridegroom dressed for his wedding. I am like a bride dressed in jewels. And a garden causes the seeds planted there to grow. In the same way the Lord God will make grow what is right. He will make praise come from all the nations."

In the same way no one ever saw a country begin in one day. No one has ever heard of a new nation beginning in one day. But Jerusalem will give birth to her children just as soon as she feels the birth pains. without allowing something new to be born,&apos; says the Lord. &apos;If I cause you the pain, I will not stop you from giving birth to your new nation,&apos; says your God. All you people who love Jerusalem, be happy. Those of you who felt sad for Jerusalem should now feel happy with her. as a child is nursed by its mother. You will receive her good things and enjoy her wealth.&apos; &apos;I will give her peace that will flow to her like a river. The wealth of the nations will come flowing to her. Like babies you will be nursed and held in my arms. You will be bounced on my knees. as a mother comforts her child. You will be comforted in Jerusalem.&apos; You will grow like the grass. The Lord&quot;s servants will see his power. But the Lord&quot;s enemies will see his anger. The Lord&quot;s armies are coming with clouds of dust. He will punish those people with his anger.
