The Bible contains many wonderful promises that God has made to us. Below are just a few of them. You might want to see what other promises you can find. One reason God&quot;s promises are special is that &apos;the Lord will keep his promises&apos; (Psalm 145:13). Doing Good Galatians 6:9 You are young, but do not let anyone treat you as if you were not important. Be an example to show the believers how they should live. Show them with your words, with the way you live, with your love, with your pure life. Then you will save yourself and those people who listen to you. Forgiveness 1 John 1:9 Giving 2 Corinthians 9:7-8 God is our protection and our strength: He always helps in times of trouble. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He saves those whose spirits have been crushed. You can be sure that I will be with you always. I will continue with you until the end of the world. Matthew 28:20 The Lord is my shepherd. I have everything I need. Remember the Lord in everything you do. And he will give you success. With God&quot;s power working in us, God can do much, much more than anything we can ask or think of. Ephesians 3:20 Yes, God is working in you to help you want to do what pleases him. Then he gives you the power to do it. Philippians 2:13 I can do all things through Christ because he gives me strength. Philippians 4:13 My Faith Joshua 1:9 I tell you the truth. If your faith is as big as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &apos;Move from here to there.&apos; And the mountain will move. All things will be possible for you. Matthew 17:20 Jesus said to her, &apos;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will have life even if he dies. And he who lives and believes in me will never die.&apos; John 11:25-26 In Christ we can come before God with freedom and without fear. We can do this through faith in Christ. Ephesians 3:12 Everyone who is a child of God has the power to win against the world. It is our faith that wins the victory against the world. So the one who wins against the world is the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 1 John 5:4-5 My Happiness Deuteronomy 6:18 Those people who know they have great spiritual needs are happy. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them. Those who are sad now are happy. God will comfort them. Those who are humble are happy. The earth will belong to them. Those who want to do right more than anything else are happy. God will fully satisfy them. Those who give mercy to others are happy. Mercy will be given to them. Those who are pure in their thinking are happy. They will be with God. Those who work to bring peace are happy. God will call them his sons. Those who are treated badly for doing good are happy. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them. My Obedience Exodus 20:12 Jesus said, &apos;Those who hear the teaching of God and obey it&ndash;they are the ones who are truly blessed.&apos; Luke 11:28 Children, obey your parents the way the Lord wants. This is the right thing to do &apos;Then everything will be well with you, and you will have a long life on the earth.&apos; My Prayers Psalm 4:3 When a good man prays, great things happen. James 5:16 God will soon save those who respect him. And his greatness will be seen in our land. For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son. God gave his Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life. John 3:16 Jesus said, &apos;Don&quot;t let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God. And trust in me. There are many rooms in my Father&quot;s house I am going there to prepare a place for you. After I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back. Then I will take you to be with me so that you may be where I am.&apos; John 14:1-3 The Lord says, &apos;I will make you wise. I will show you where to go. I will guide you and watch over you.&apos; Listen to advice and accept correction. Then in the end you will be wise. But if any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. God is generous. He enjoys giving to all people, so God will give you wisdom. James 1:5 Always be humble and gentle. Be patient and accept each other with love. Ephesians 4:2 A friend loves you all the time. Proverbs 17:17 But I tell you, love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you. Matthew 5:44 Do what is right to other people. Love being kind to others. And live humbly, trusting your God. Do for other people what you want them to do for you. Luke 6:31 Depend on the Lord. Trust him, and he will take care of you. Being afraid of people can get you into trouble. But if you trust the Lord, you will be safe. Do not worry about anything. But pray and ask God for everything you need. Philippians 4:6 My child, do not reject the Lord&quot;s discipline. And don&quot;t become angry when he corrects you. The Lord corrects those he loves just as a father corrects the child that he likes. Give all your worries to him, because he cares for you. 1 Peter 5:7 A gentle answer will calm a person&quot;s anger. But an unkind answer will cause more anger. Love patiently accepts all things. It always trusts, always hopes, and always continues strong. 1 Corinthians 13:7 Those who work to bring peace are happy. God will call them his sons. Serve the Lord with joy. Come before him with singing . . . Come into his city with songs of thanksgiving. Come into his courtyards with songs of praise. Thank him, and praise his name. If someone does wrong to you, do not pay him back by doing wrong to him. Try to do what everyone thinks is right. Do your best to live in peace with everyone. Romans 12:17-18 Praise the Lord! Thank the Lord because he is good. His love continues forever. Do not be bitter or angry or mad. Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others. Never do anything evil. Be kind and loving to each other. Forgive each other just as God forgave you in Christ. Ephesians 4:31-32 Happy is the person whose sins are forgiven, whose wrongs are pardoned. Be happy with those who are happy. Romans 12:15 Wait for the Lord&quot;s help. Be strong and brave and wait for the Lord&quot;s help. Be full of joy in the Lord always. I will say again, be full of joy. Philippians 4:4 But the people who trust the Lord will become strong again. They will be able to rise up as an eagle in the sky. They will run without needing rest. They will walk without becoming tired. Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads. I will give you rest. Matthew 11:28 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his great power. Ephesians 6:10 Those who want to do right more than anything else are happy. God will fully satisfy them. If you love me, you will do the things I command. John 14:15 Do not let evil defeat you. Defeat evil by doing good. Romans 12:21 Your word is like a lamp for my feet and a light for my way. Psalm 119:105 The only temptations that you have are the temptations that all people have. But you can trust God. He will not let you be tempted more than you can stand. But when you are tempted, God will also give you a way to escape that temptation. Then you will be able to stand it. 1 Corinthians 10:13 When a person is tempted and still continues strong, he should be happy. After he has proved his faith, God will reward him with life forever. God promised this to all people who love him. James 1:12 Dear children, do not let any person lead you the wrong way. Christ is righteous.
