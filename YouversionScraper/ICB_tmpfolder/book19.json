My call for help reached his ears. The foundations of the mountains began to shake. They shook because the Lord was angry. Burning fire came out of his mouth. Burning coals went before him. Dark clouds were under his feet. He flew on the wings of the wind. surrounded by fog and clouds. They came with hail and lightning. God Most High raised his voice. And there was hail and lightning. His many bolts of lightning confused them with fear. The wind blew from your nose. The valleys of the sea appeared. The foundations of the earth were seen. He pulled me from the deep water. Those who hated me were too strong for me. But the Lord supported me. Because he delights in me, he saved me. Because I have not done evil, he has rewarded me. I have not done evil by turning away from my God. I have not broken his rules. I have kept myself from doing evil. I did what the Lord said was right. You are good to those who are good. But you are against those who are bad. But you make humble those who are proud. My God brightens the darkness around me. With God&quot;s help I can jump over a wall. The Lord&quot;s words are pure. He is a shield to those who trust him. Who is the Rock? Only our God. He makes my way free from fault. He helps me stand on the steep mountains. So my arms can bend a bronze bow. You support me with your right hand. You have stooped to make me great. My feet have not slipped. I did not quit till they were destroyed. They fell beneath my feet. You made my enemies bow before me. I destroyed those who hated me. but no one came to save them. They called to the Lord, but he did not answer them. They were like dust in the wind. I poured them out like mud in the streets. You made me the leader of nations. People I never knew serve me. Foreigners obey me. They tremble in their hiding places. May my Rock be praised. Praise the God who saves me! He brings people under my rule. You set me over those who hate me. You saved me from cruel men. I will sing praises to your name. He is loyal to his appointed king, to David and his descendants forever."

We will tell those who come later about the praises of the Lord. We will tell about his power and the miracles he has done. He gave the teachings to Israel. And he commanded our ancestors to teach them to their children. even their children not yet born. And they would tell their children. They would not forget what God had done. Instead, they would obey his commands. who were stubborn and disobedient. Their hearts were not loyal to God. They were not true to him. But they ran away on the day of battle. They refused to live by his teachings. and the miracles he had shown them. in the fields of Zoan in Egypt. He made the water stand up like a wall. And he led them at night by the light of a fire. And he gave them much water, as if it were from the deep ocean. The water flowed down like rivers. In the desert they turned against God Most High. by asking for the food they wanted. They said, &apos;Can God prepare food in the desert? Rivers flowed down. But can he give us bread also? Will he provide his people with meat?&apos; His anger was like fire to the people of Jacob. His anger grew against the people of Israel. They had not trusted him to save them. The doors of heaven opened. He gave them grain from heaven. He sent them all the food they could eat. He led the south wind by his power. The birds were as many as the sand of the sea. all around the tents. God had given them what they wanted. and while the food was still in their mouths, He killed some of the healthiest of them. He struck down the best young men of Israel. They did not believe even with the miracles. and their years in terror. They would come back to God and follow him. that God Most High had saved them. Their tongues lied to him. They did not keep his agreement. He forgave their sins. He did not destroy them. Many times he held back his anger. He did not stir up all his anger. They were like a wind that blows and does not come back. There they made him very sad. They brought pain to the Holy One of Israel. or the time he saved them from the enemy. and his miracles in the fields of Zoan. So no one could drink the water. He sent frogs that destroyed them. and what they worked for to locusts. and their sycamore trees with sleet. and their cattle with lightning. He sent his strong anger against them. He sent his destroying angels. He did not keep them from dying. He let them die by a terrible disease. He guided them like a flock through the desert. But their enemies drowned in the sea. He brought them to the mountain country he took with his own power. And he had his people inherit the land. He let the tribes of Israel settle there in tents. and turned against the Most High. They did not keep his rules. They were like a crooked bow that does not shoot straight. They made him jealous with their idols. And he rejected the people of Israel completely. the tent where he lived among men. He let the Ark of the Covenant, which was his glory, be taken by enemies. He was very angry with his children. The young women had no one to marry. But their widows were not allowed to cry. He awoke like a man who was drunk with wine. He disgraced them forever. He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. and Mount Zion, which he loves. Like the earth, he built it to last forever. He took him from the sheep pens. so he could lead the flock, the people of Jacob. This flock was his own people, the people of Israel. He guided them with skillful hands."
