Those who tried to hurt Israel were judged guilty. Disasters happened to them,&quot;&apos; says the Lord. Hear the message, all you family groups of Israel. &apos;I was fair to your ancestors. Why did they turn away from me? Your ancestors worshiped useless idols. And they became useless themselves. &quot;The Lord brought us out of Egypt. He led us through the desert. He led us through a dry and rocky land. He led us through a dark and dangerous land. He led us where no one travels or lives. But where is he now?&quot; I did this so you could eat its fruit and produce. But you came and made my land unclean. You made it a hated place. &quot;Where is the Lord?&quot; The people who know the teachings didn&quot;t know me. The leaders turned against me. The prophets prophesied in the name of Baal. They worshiped useless idols. &apos;And I will tell what I have against your grandchildren. Send someone to the land of Kedar to look closely. See if there has ever been anything like this! (Of course, their gods are not really gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their glorious God for idols worth nothing! Shake with great fear!&apos; says the Lord. They have turned away from me. And I am the spring of living water. And they have dug their own wells. But they are broken wells that cannot hold water. Have they become like someone who was born a slave? Why was their wealth stolen? They growl at Israel. They have destroyed the land of Israel. The cities of Israel have been burned, and all the people have left. have disgraced you by shaving the top of your head. You turned away from me, the Lord your God, when I led you in the way. and drink from the Shihor River. It did not help to go to Assyria and drink from the Euphrates River. The wrong you have done will teach you a lesson. Think about it and understand. It is a terrible evil to turn away from the Lord your God. It is wrong not to fear me,&apos; says the Lord, the Lord of heaven&quot;s armies. You broke the ropes I used to hold you to me. You said to me, &quot;I will not serve you!&quot; In fact, on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down as a prostitute. You were like very good seed. How then did you turn into a wild vine that grows bad fruit? And you might use much soap. But I can still see the stain of your guilt,&apos; says the Lord God. I have not worshiped the Baal idols&quot;? Think about the things you did in the valley. Think about what you have done. You are like a she-camel in mating season that runs from place to place. At mating time she sniffs the wind. At that time no one can hold her back. Any male who chases her will easily catch her. At mating time, it is easy to find her. or until your throat is dry. But you say, &quot;It&quot;s no use! I love those other gods. I must worship them!&quot; In the same way the family of Israel is ashamed. The kings and the officers, the priests and the prophets are ashamed. They say to idols of stone, &quot;You gave birth to me.&quot; Those people won&quot;t look at me. They have turned their backs to me. But when they get into trouble, they say, &quot;Come and save us!&quot; Let them come and save you when you are in trouble! People of Judah, you have as many idols as you have towns! All of you have turned against me,&apos; says the Lord. They didn&quot;t come back when they were punished. You killed with your swords the prophets who came to you. You were like a dangerous lion. Have I been like a desert to the people of Israel? Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to them? Why do my people say, &quot;We are free to wander. We won&quot;t come to you anymore&quot;? A bride does not forget the decorations for her dress. But my people have forgotten me for more days than can be counted! Even the worst women can learn evil ways from you. It is the blood of the poor and innocent people. You killed them, but they weren&quot;t thieves you had caught breaking in. You do all these things, God is not angry with me.&quot; But I will judge you guilty of lying. It is because you say, &quot;I have not sinned.&quot; Assyria let you down. And Egypt will let you down, too. And, like captives, your hands will be on your head. You trusted those countries. But you will not be helped by them. This is because the Lord has rejected them."

If you don&quot;t listen, I will turn my back on you. I will make your land an empty desert. No one will be able to live there!&apos; &apos;Gather the few people of Israel who are left alive.

I was a husband to them, but they broke that agreement,&apos; says the Lord. with the people of Israel,&apos; says the Lord. &apos;I will put my teachings in their minds. And I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. to know the Lord.

Her little children will cry for help. They cry loudly as they go. On the road down to the town of Horonaim, cries of pain and suffering can be heard. Go like a bush being blown through the desert. So you also will be captured. The god Chemosh will be taken into captivity. And his priests and officers will be taken with him. Not one town will escape. The valley will be ruined. The high plain will be destroyed. The Lord said this would happen. The country will be an empty desert. Moab&quot;s towns will become empty. No one will live in them. A curse will be on anyone who keeps back his sword from killing. They are like wine left to settle. They have never been poured like wine from one jar to another. They have not been taken into captivity. So they taste as they did before. And their smell has not changed. &apos;And I will soon send men to pour you from your jars. Those men will empty Moab&quot;s jars. And they will smash their jugs. They were ashamed when there was no help. In the same way Moab will be ashamed of their god Chemosh. We are brave men in battle!&quot; Their best young men will be killed!&apos; says the King. The King&quot;s name is the Lord of heaven&quot;s armies. They will soon be destroyed. All you who know about her, cry for her. Say, &quot;The ruler&quot;s power is broken. Moab&quot;s power and glory are gone.&quot; Sit on the dry ground. This is because the destroyer of Moab is coming against you. And he will destroy your strong, walled cities. stand next to the road and watch. See the man running away and the woman escaping. Ask them what happened. Cry, Moab, cry out! Announce at the Arnon River that Moab is destroyed. Judgment has come to these towns: Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath; Judgment has come to all the towns of Moab, far and near. Moab&quot;s arm is broken!&apos; says the Lord. So punish Moab until they act as if they are drunk. Moab will fall and roll around in their own vomit. People will make fun of them. Israel was caught in the middle of a gang of thieves. You often spoke about Israel. And you shook your head and acted as if you were better than Israel. Go live among the rocks. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the entrance of a cave! and very conceited. They are proud and think they are important. They were very proud in their hearts.&apos; &apos;I know Moab&quot;s quick anger, but it is useless. Moab&quot;s bragging accomplishes nothing. I cry out for everyone in Moab. I moan for the men from Kir Hareseth. for the grapevines of Sibmah. In the past your vines spread all the way to the sea. They reached as far as the sea of Jazer. But the destroyer has taken your fruit and grapes. from the large fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses. No one walks on the grapes with shouts of joy. There are shouts, but not shouts of joy. from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz. It can be heard from Zoar as far away as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up. from making burnt offerings at the places of worship. I will stop them from burning incense to their gods,&apos; says the Lord. It cries for the people from Kir Hareseth. Their money and riches have all been taken away. Everyone&quot;s beard is cut off. Everyone&quot;s hands are cut. and in every public square. There is nothing but sadness because I have broken Moab like a jar no one wants,&apos; says the Lord. Moab turns away in shame! People all around her make fun of her. The things that happened fill them with fear.&apos; &apos;Look! An eagle is diving down from the sky. It spreads its wings over Moab. The strong, walled cities will be defeated. At that time Moab&quot;s warriors will be frightened. They will feel pain like a woman who is having a baby. This is because they thought they were greater than the Lord. people of Moab,&apos; says the Lord. But they will fall into the pits. Anyone who climbs out of the pits will be caught in the traps. I will bring the year of punishment to Moab,&apos; says the Lord. They ran to Heshbon for safety. But fire started in Heshbon. A blaze broke out in Sihon&quot;s town. And it burns the leaders of Moab. It destroys those proud people. Chemosh&quot;s people are being destroyed. Your sons and daughters are being taken away as captives. I will make good things happen again to Moab,&apos; says the Lord. This ends the judgment on Moab."

Maybe that is why Molech&quot;s people live in Gad&quot;s towns.&apos; &apos;The time will come when I will make the capital city of Rabbah Ammon hear the battle cry. It will be a hill covered with ruins. And the towns around it will be burned. Those people forced Israel out of that land. But now the people of Israel will force them out!&apos; says the Lord. Those who live in Rabbah Ammon, cry out! Put on your rough cloth to show your sadness, and cry loudly. Run here and there for safety inside the walls. This is because the enemy will take Molech away as a captive. They will also take away his priests and officers with him. You brag about the fruit in your valleys. You are like an unfaithful child. You believe your treasures will save you. You think, &quot;Who would attack me?&quot; from every side,&apos; says the Master, the Lord of heaven&quot;s armies. &apos;You will all be forced away. No one will be able to gather you. when I will make good things happen to the Ammonites again,&apos; says the Lord. &apos;Is there no more wisdom in Teman?

This is because I will punish the people of Esau with disaster for what they did. they would leave a few grapes behind. If robbers came at night, they would steal only enough for themselves. I will find all their hiding places. They will not be able to hide from me. The children, relatives and neighbors will die. Your widows also can trust in me.&apos; A messenger has been sent among the nations, saying, &apos;Gather your armies to attack it! Get ready for battle!&apos; You will be greatly hated. Your pride has fooled you. You live in the hollow places of the cliff. You live on the high places of the hills.

There is no one like me. There is no one who can challenge me. None of their leaders can stand up against me.&apos; Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in Teman. The Lord will surely drag away the young ones of Edom. Edom&quot;s pastures will surely be destroyed because of them. Their cry will be heard all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba. He is like an eagle spreading its wings over the city of Bozrah. At that time Edom&quot;s soldiers will become very frightened. They will be crying from fear like a woman having a baby. &apos;The towns of Hamath and Arpad are put to shame. They are afraid because they have heard bad news. They are discouraged. They are troubled like the tossing sea. The people want to run away. The people are ready to panic. The people feel pain and suffering like a woman having a baby. Why have the people not left that famous city yet? All of her soldiers will be killed at that time,&apos; says the Lord of heaven&quot;s armies.

He has made plans to defeat you! It is sure that no one will defeat it,&apos; says the Lord. &apos;That nation does not have gates or fences to protect it. Its people live alone. Attack that nation! and their large herds of cattle. I will scatter the Arabs to every part of the earth. And I will bring disaster on them from everywhere,&apos; says the Lord. It will become an empty desert forever. No one will live there. No man will stay in it.&apos; &apos;I will break Elam&quot;s bow. I will break its strength. I will bring them from the four corners of the skies. I will scatter the people of Elam everywhere the four winds blow. And its captives will go to every nation. The enemies want to destroy Elam. I will bring disaster to Elam. I will show them how angry I am!&apos; says the Lord. &apos;I will send a sword to chase Elam. It will chase them until I have killed them all.

And the sound is loud like the roaring sea. They stand in their places, ready for battle. They are ready to attack you, city of Babylon. And he became helpless because of his fear. His fear is like pain. It is like the pain of a woman having a baby. It will go into the rich pastures where people feed their flocks. I am like that lion! I will suddenly chase the people of Babylon from their land. Who is the one I have chosen to do this? There is no one like me. There is no one who can challenge me. None of their leaders can stand up against me.&apos; Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in Babylon. He will surely drag away the young ones of Babylon.

I use you to smash young men and young women. I use you to smash farmers and oxen. I use you to smash governors and officers. &apos;Babylon, you are a destroying mountain. And I am against you. You have destroyed the whole land. I will put my hand out against you. I will roll you off the cliffs. I will make you a burned-out mountain. People will not take any rocks from Babylon to use for the foundation of a building. This is because your city will be just a pile of ruins forever,&apos; says the Lord. Blow the trumpet among the nations! Get the nations ready for battle against Babylon. Call these kingdoms to come fight against Babylon: Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Choose a commander to lead the army against Babylon. Send so many horses that they are like a swarm of locusts. Get the kings of the Medes ready. Get their governors and all their officers ready. Get all the countries they rule ready for battle against Babylon. It will shake when the Lord does what he planned to Babylon. His plan is to make Babylon into an empty desert. No one will live there. They stay in their protected cities. Their strength is gone. They have become like frightened women. Babylon&quot;s houses are burning. The bars of her gates are broken. Messenger follows messenger. They announce to the king of Babylon that his whole city has been captured. The swamplands are burning. All of Babylon&quot;s soldiers are terribly afraid.&apos; &apos;The city of Babylon is like a threshing floor, where people crush the grain at harvest time. The time to harvest Babylon is coming soon.&apos; In the past he took our people away. And we became like an empty jar. He was like a giant snake that swallowed us. He ate everything until he was full of our best things. Then he spit us out. Now let those things happen to Babylon,&apos; say the people of Jerusalem. &apos;The people of Babylon are guilty of killing our people. Now let them be punished for the evil they did,&apos; says Jerusalem. &apos;I will defend you, Judah. I will make sure that Babylon is punished. I will dry up Babylon&quot;s sea. And I will make her springs become dry. Wild dogs will live there. People will be shocked by what happened there. No one lives there anymore. They growl like baby lions. I will give a feast for them. I will make them drunk. They will shout and laugh. And they will sleep forever and never wake up!&apos; says the Lord. They will be like lambs, like male sheep and goats waiting to be killed. The pride of the whole earth will be taken captive. People from other nations will be shocked at what happened to Babylon. And the things they see will make them afraid. Its roaring waves will cover her. Babylon will become a dry, desert land. It will become a land where no one lives. People will not even travel through Babylon. I will make him spit out what he has swallowed. Nations will no longer come to Babylon. And the wall around the city will fall. Run for your lives! Run from the Lord&quot;s great anger. Rumors will spread, but don&quot;t be afraid. One rumor comes this year, and another comes the next year. There will be rumors of terrible fighting in the country. There will be rumors of rulers fighting against rulers. when I will punish the idols of Babylon. And the whole land will be disgraced. There will be many dead people lying all around. will shout for joy about Babylon. They will shout because the army came from the north and fought against Babylon,&apos; says the Lord. Babylon killed people from everywhere on earth. So Babylon must fall. You must hurry and leave Babylon. Don&quot;t wait! Remember the Lord in the faraway land where you are. And think about Jerusalem.&apos; We have been insulted. We have been shamed. This is because strangers have gone into the holy places of the Lord&quot;s Temple!&apos; when I will punish the idols of Babylon. Wounded people will cry with pain all over that land. She might make her cities strong. But I will send people to destroy that city,&apos; says the Lord. We hear the sound of people destroying things in the land of the Babylonians. He will make the loud sounds of the city become silent. Enemies will come roaring in like ocean waves. People all around will hear that roar. Babylon&quot;s soldiers will be taken captive. Their bows will be broken. This is because the Lord is a God who punishes people for the evil they do. He gives them the full punishment they deserve. I will make her governors, officers and soldiers drunk, too. Then they will sleep forever and never wake up,&apos; says the King. His name is the Lord of heaven&quot;s armies. &apos;Babylon&quot;s thick wall will be pulled down. Her high gates will be burned. The people will work hard, but it won&quot;t help. Their work will only become fuel for the flames!&apos; The words of Jeremiah end here."
