He has doomed them to destruction and will annihilate them all. the stench of their corpses will rise, and the mountains will stream with their blood. and the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll. All their mighty host will wither as leaves fall from a withered vine and when it has drunk its fill, you will see it descend on the people of Edom, those whom I have doomed to judgment.&apos; It is smeared with fat, dripping with the blood of lambs and goats, and covered with the fat of rams&quot; kidneys. and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. and the dust soaked with fat. a year of vindication for Zion&quot;s cause. her land will become blazing pitch. its smoke will go up forever and ever. Through the endless ages it will lie desolate; no one will pass through it forever. owls and ravens will find a home there. The Lord will stretch out over it a measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of emptiness. and hatch her brood in the shadows. You will learn that none of these prophecies will fail; none will lack a fulfillment as its companion. For the Lord has issued his decree. It is his Spirit that has gathered them. They will possess it for all time and dwell there throughout the ages."

We wait and wait for justice, but it never seems to come; for salvation, but it remains distant. our sins testify against us. We are aware of our sins, and we know our evil deeds all too well. we have forsaken our God. Our speech stirs up oppression and revolt, and righteousness stands on the sidelines, for truth has stumbled in the public square and morality cannot enter. and those who turn from evil become the next victims. Yahweh saw this and was greatly displeased that there was no justice. and his own righteousness supported him. salvation for a helmet; a garment of warring vengeance was his uniform and passion, his cape. and retribution to his foes, according to what they have done.
