He placed it like a willow tree by the side of a flowing stream. and its roots grew down deep into the soil. So, it became a vine, branching out and sprouting new shoots. with huge wings and many feathers around its head. And soon the vine bent its roots toward him and stretched its branches toward this eagle from the place where it was planted, expecting this eagle to nourish it. so that the vine could branch out, bear fruit, and become a wonderful vine. Will the vine thrive? Will not the first eagle come and tear out its roots? Will it not strip off its grapes so that all its foliage withers? Then, even weak ones could easily uproot it! Will it not wither in the fertile soil where it had grown?&apos; &apos;I will take the highest branch from a cedar tree. I will break off from the very top a tender shoot and plant it myself on a high and lofty mountain. Yes, in the shade of its branches the birds will make their nests. who brings the tall tree low and raises the low tree high, I, Yahweh , have spoken and have done it!&apos;"
