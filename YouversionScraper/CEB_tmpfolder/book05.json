Isn&quot;t he your father, your creator? Didn&quot;t he make you and establish you? consider the years long gone. Ask your father, he will tell you about it; ask your elders, they will give you the details: when he divided up humankind&ndash; he decided the people&quot;s boundaries Jacob was his part of the inheritance. in a howling desert wasteland&ndash; he protected him, cared for him, watched over him with his very own eye. hovering over its young, God spread out his wings, took hold of Israel, carried him on his back. no foreign god assisted. nursed him with honey from a boulder, with oil from a hard rock: along with the best of lambs, rams from Bashan, he-goats too, along with the finest wheat&ndash; and for drink, wine from the juiciest grapes! thought the rock of his salvation was worthless. aggravated him with detestable things. to deities of which they had no knowledge&ndash; new gods only recently on the scene, you forgot the God who gave birth to you!

They might say, &apos;Our strong hands, not the LORD &quot;s, did all this,&apos; they lack any insight. they would discern what will become of them. How could two people make ten thousand flee for their lives? Only because their rock sold them off, only because the LORD handed them over! from the fields of Gomorrah! Their grapes are pure poison; their grape clusters, nothing but bitter; venom from a cruel cobra. sealed in my vaults? at the exact moment their step slips up, because the day of their destruction is just around the corner; their final destiny is speeding on its way! will have compassion on those who serve him, once he sees that their strength is all gone, the rocks they trusted in&ndash; who drank their sacred wine? They should stand up and help you! They should protect you now! there are no other gods with me. I&quot;m the one who deals death and gives life; I&quot;m the one who wounded, but now I will heal. There&quot;s no escaping my hand. I swear by my own eternity: and my hand grabs hold of justice, I&quot;ll pay my enemies back; I&quot;ll punish in kind everyone who hates me. while my sword devours flesh, the blood of the dead and captured, he will pay back his enemies;"
