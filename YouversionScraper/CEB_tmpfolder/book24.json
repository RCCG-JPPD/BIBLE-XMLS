What wrong did your ancestors find in me that made them wander so far? They pursued what was worthless and became worthless. &apos;Where&quot;s the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, in a land of deserts and ravines, in a land of drought and darkness, in a land of no return, where no one survives?&apos; to enjoy its gifts and goodness, but you ruined my land; you disgraced my heritage. &apos;Where&quot;s the LORD ?&apos; Those responsible for the Instruction didn&quot;t know me; the leaders rebelled against me; the prophets spoke in the name of Baal, going after what has no value. and charge even your descendants, declares the LORD . and to the east as far as the land of Kedar. Ask anyone there: Has anything this odd ever taken place? though they aren&quot;t really gods at all? Yet my people have exchanged their glory for what has no value. shudder and quake, declares the LORD . They have forsaken me, the spring of living water. And they have dug wells, broken wells that can&quot;t hold water. a servant by birth? If not, why then has he become prey? They destroy his land and make his towns desolate until nothing is left. lay open your scalp. by abandoning the LORD your God, who has directed your paths? to drink water from the Nile?

But even then you said, &apos;I won&quot;t serve you.&apos; On every high hill and under every lush tree, you have acted like a prostitute. how could you turn into a wild vine and become good for nothing? the stain of your sin is still before me, declares the LORD God. &apos;I&quot;m not dirty; I haven&quot;t gone after Baals.&apos; Look what you have done in the valley; consider what you have done there. You are like a frenzied young camel, racing around, lustfully sniffing the wind. Who can restrain such passion? Those who desire her need not give up; with little effort they will find her in heat. and your throat is parched. But you say, &apos;What&quot;s the use? I have fallen in love with foreign gods, and I must pursue them.&apos; so the people of Israel are ashamed&ndash; their kings, officials, priests, and prophets&ndash; and to a stone, &apos;You gave me birth.&apos; They have turned their backs to me and not their faces. Yet in their time of trouble they say, &apos;Arise and save us!&apos; you have made for yourselves? Let&quot;s see if they will come through for you in your time of trouble. You have as many gods, Judah, as you have towns. You have all rebelled against me, declares the LORD . they have rejected my correction. You have devoured your prophets like a hungry lion. Have I been a wasteland to Israel or a land of dense darkness? Why then do my people say, &apos;We have wandered far away; we&quot;ll come to you no longer&apos;? or a bride her wedding dress? Yet you have forgotten me days without end! with the blood of the innocent poor, even though you didn&quot;t catch them breaking and entering. &apos;I&quot;m innocent; as a result he will turn his anger away from me.&apos; Because you claim not to have sinned, I will pass judgment against you.

Therefore, they will fall among the fallen and stumble when I bring disaster, declares the LORD . Stop at the crossroads and look around; ask for the ancient paths. Where is the good way? Then walk in it and find a resting place for yourselves. take notice, assembly, I&quot;m bringing disaster upon my people, the fruit of their own devices, because they have ignored my words and they have rejected my teaching. or sweet cane from a faraway land? Your entirely burned offerings won&quot;t buy your pardon; your sacrifices won&quot;t appease me. I&quot;m putting obstacles before this people, and both parents and children will stumble over them; neighbor and friend alike will perish. An army is on the move from the northern regions; a great nation is roused from the ends of the earth. they are cruel; they show no mercy. Their horsemen sound like the roaring sea, arrayed in battle formation against you, Daughter Zion. and are panic-stricken; distress overwhelms us, pain like that of a woman in labor. Don&quot;t walk on the road! The enemies&quot; sword terrorizes at every turn. put on funeral clothes and roll in ashes; weep and wail as for an only child, because the destroyer will suddenly descend upon us. to know and prove their ways. they are headstrong and rebellious. They live to slander. They act corruptly&ndash;every last one! Yet the refining fails; for the LORD has rejected them."

On that day, the heart of every soldier from Moab will be like that of a woman in the throes of labor. because it has exalted itself above the LORD . are upon you, people of Moab, declares the LORD . will fall into a pit; those who escape the pit will be captured by the trap. I will bring upon Moab the year of its punishment, declares the LORD . But fire is raging in Heshbon, It has burned up part of Moab, the people of Chemosh have perished. Your sons have been carried off; your daughters have been taken captive. I&quot;ll bring back Moab from captivity, declares the LORD . Such is the judgment on Moab."

Her images are shamed; her idols are panic-stricken.&apos; has risen up against her. It will decimate her land, and no one will live in it.

She will become the least of the nations: a wilderness, a desert, and parched land. no one will live there; she will be reduced to total ruin. All who pass by Babylon will be shocked; they will gasp at all her injuries. all you archers; now shoot at her; save none of your arrows, because she&quot;s sinned against the LORD .

How terrible for them! Their time has come, the day of reckoning. from the land of Babylon, declaring in Zion the retribution of the LORD our God because of what has been done to his temple. all who draw the bow! Surround her and let no one escape. Pay her back for her deeds; do to her what she&quot;s done to others.

It is truly the land of idols, idols about which they have gone utterly mad! a place for desert animals, No one will live there again; no one will make it their home. declares the LORD , so no one will live in Babylon or settle there again. from the northern regions. A powerful nation and many kings are coming from the ends of the earth. they are cruel and show no mercy. Their horsemen sound like the roaring sea, arrayed in battle formation against you, Daughter Babylon. and is panic-stricken; distress overwhelms him, pain like that of a woman in labor. the jungle of the Jordan so I will suddenly chase down Babylon and single out its choicest of rams. Who is like me? Who can direct me? What shepherd can withstand me? that the LORD has for Babylon and the plans he&quot;s devised against the land of Babylon: The little ones of the flock will be dragged off, as their pasture watches at the sound of Babylon&quot;s capture; its screams echo throughout the world."

Sometimes you hear one thing and another time something else: rumors of violence and uprisings. when I will deal with Babylon&quot;s idols; the whole land will be disgraced, and her wounded will fall in her midst. because out of the north destroying armies will come to attack her, declares the LORD . for the dead in Israel, as the dead of all the earth have fallen to Babylon. leave now; don&quot;t delay! Remember the LORD , from a faraway land. Keep Jerusalem alive in your hearts. we&quot;re disgraced that strangers have violated the sacred places of the LORD &quot;s temple. declares the LORD , when I will deal with her idols, and the wounded in her land will groan. and strengthens its towering defenses, the destroying armies will still come against her, at my command, declares the LORD . signs of massive devastation in the land, declares the LORD . and silencing her outcry, whose roar is like the crushing waves, a deafening crash. the destroyer comes against Babylon. Her warriors are captured; their bows are broken. The LORD is an exacting God who repays in full. her governors, officials, and warriors as well. They will sleep forever, never to get up, declares the king, whose name is the LORD of heavenly forces. Babylon&quot;s massive walls will come down, down to the ground; and its high gates will be burned to the ground. People labor in vain; nations toil for nothing but ashes!
