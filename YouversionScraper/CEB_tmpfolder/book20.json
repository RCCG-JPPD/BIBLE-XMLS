Who has bound up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is this person&quot;s name and the name of this person&quot;s child&ndash; if you know it? a shield for those who take refuge in him. or he will correct you and show you to be a liar. don&quot;t keep them from me before I die: keep far from me! Don&quot;t give me either poverty or wealth; give me just the food I need. and say, &apos;Who is the LORD ?&apos; Or I&quot;ll be poor and steal, and dishonor my God&quot;s name. otherwise, the servant will curse you, and you will be guilty. and don&quot;t bless their mother. but haven&quot;t washed off their own excrement. how arrogant are their eyes; how their eyebrows are raised! their jaw is a butcher&quot;s knife, ready to devour the needy from the earth, and the poor from humanity.
