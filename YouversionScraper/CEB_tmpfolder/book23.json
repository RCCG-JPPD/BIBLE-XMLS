But Israel doesn&quot;t know; my people don&quot;t behave intelligently. evildoing offspring, corrupt children! They have abandoned the LORD , despised the holy one of Israel; they turned their backs on God. Why continue to rebel? Everyone&quot;s head throbs, and everyone&quot;s heart fails. only bruises, cuts, and raw wounds, not treated, not bandaged, not soothed with oil. your cities burned with fire; your land&ndash;strangers are devouring it in plain sight. It&quot;s a wasteland, as when foreigners raid. like a hut in a cucumber field, we would be like Sodom; we would resemble Gomorrah. Listen to our God&quot;s teaching, people of Gomorrah! says the LORD . I&quot;m fed up with entirely burned offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts. I don&quot;t want the blood of bulls, lambs, and goats. who asked this from you, this trampling of my temple&quot;s courts? Your incense repulses me. New moon, sabbath, and the calling of an assembly&ndash; I can&quot;t stand wickedness with celebration! They&quot;ve become a burden that I&quot;m tired of bearing. I&quot;ll hide my eyes from you. Even when you pray for a long time, I won&quot;t listen. Your hands are stained with blood. Remove your ugly deeds from my sight. Put an end to such evil; Seek justice: defend the orphan; plead for the widow. says the LORD . Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white as snow. If they are red as crimson, they will become like wool. you will eat the best food of the land. you will be devoured by the sword. The LORD has said this. She was full of justice; righteousness lived in her&ndash; but now murderers. your beer is diluted with water. companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and pursues gifts. They don&quot;t defend the orphan, and the widow&quot;s cause never reaches them. the mighty one of Israel: Doom! I will vent my anger against my foes; I will take it out on my enemies, I will refine your impurities as with lye, and remove all your cinders. and your counselors as at the beginning. After this you will be called Righteous City, Faithful Town. and those who change their lives by righteousness. those who abandon the LORD will be finished. and embarrassed by the gardens you once chose. like a garden without water. their deeds like sparks; the two will burn together, with no one to extinguish them."

God will rise up against the house of evildoers and against the help of those who do wrong. their horses are flesh and not spirit. The LORD will extend his hand; the helper will stumble, those helped will fall, and they will all die together. When the lion growls, the young lion, over its prey, though a band of shepherds is summoned against it, isn&quot;t scared off by their noise or frightened by their roar. So the LORD of heavenly forces will go down to fight on Mount Zion and on her hill. so the LORD of heavenly forces will shield Jerusalem: shielding and saving, sparing and rescuing. a sword not made by humans will devour them. They will flee before the sword; their young men will become forced laborers. their officers will be terrified at the signal, says the LORD , whose fire is in Zion and whose oven is in Jerusalem."

I was bereaved and desolate, exiled and sent off. So who raised these? I was left behind, I was alone; where were these? Look, I will raise my hand to the nations, and to the peoples I will lift up my signal. They will bring your sons in their arms, and will carry your daughters on their shoulders. and their queens your nursemaids. With faces to the ground they will bow down to you; they will lick the dust from your feet. You will know that I am the LORD ; the one who hopes in me won&quot;t be ashamed. Can a tyrant&quot;s captives escape? Even the captives of warriors will be taken, and the tyrant&quot;s loot will escape. I myself will oppose those who oppose you, and I myself will save your children. and as with wine, with their own blood they will be drunk, so that all flesh will know that I, the LORD , am your savior, and the mighty one of Jacob is your redeemer."

I will make peace your governor and righteousness your taskmaster. nor devastation or destruction within your borders. You will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise. The LORD will be your everlasting light; your God will be your glory. your moon will no longer wane. The LORD will be an everlasting light for you, and your days of mourning will be ended. they will possess the land forever. They are the shoot that I planted, the work of my hands, to glorify myself. and the smallest a powerful people. I am the LORD ; at the right moment, I will hurry it along."

I&quot;m here!&apos; to a nation that didn&quot;t call on my name. to a rebellious people walking in a way that isn&quot;t good, following their own plans; sacrificing in gardens and burning incense on bricks, who eat swine&quot;s flesh with broth of unclean meat in their bowls; Keep away from me! I&quot;m too holy for you.&apos; These people ignite my anger like a fire that burns all day. I won&quot;t be silent, but I will repay; I will repay in full measure says the LORD . Since they burned incense on the mountains, and mocked me in the hills, I will count out to them full payment for their actions. As new wine is found in the grape cluster, and someone says, &apos;Don&quot;t destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,&apos; so I will do for the sake of my servants and not destroy everything: and from Judah, heirs to my mountains. My chosen ones will take possession; my servants will dwell there. and the Achor Valley a resting place for cattle, for my people who seek me. who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for a god of good fortune, and fill cups of mixed wine for a god of fate: You will all bow down for slaughter, because I called and you didn&quot;t answer; I spoke and you wouldn&quot;t hear. You did what I considered evil, and chose what I didn&quot;t want. Look, my servants will eat, but you will hunger. My servants will drink, but you will thirst. My servants will rejoice, but you will be ashamed. but you will cry out from heartache; with broken spirits you will wail. &apos;May the LORD God kill you! May he call his servants by a different name!&apos; will do so by the God called Amen; Past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my sight. past events won&quot;t be remembered; they won&quot;t come to mind. in what I&quot;m creating, because I&quot;m creating Jerusalem as a joy and her people as a source of gladness. No one will ever hear the sound of weeping or crying in it again. or the old fail to live out their days. The one who dies at a hundred will be like a young person, and the one falling short of a hundred will seem cursed. they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. nor plant for others to eat. Like the days of a tree will be the days of my people; my chosen will make full use of their handiwork. nor bear children to a world of horrors, because they will be people blessed by the LORD , they along with their descendants. while they are still speaking, I will hear. and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but the snake&ndash;its food will be dust. They won&quot;t hurt or destroy at any place on my holy mountain, says the LORD ."

All these have chosen their own ways, and prefer their detestable things. to bring horrors upon them, since I called and no one answered. I spoke and no one heard, but they did evil in my eyes. What I didn&quot;t want, they chose. you who tremble at his word: Your family members, those who hate and exclude you because of my name, have said, &apos;Let the LORD be glorified; let&quot;s see your joy.&apos; But they will be ashamed. The sound of the LORD repaying his enemies what they have earned. Before her pangs came upon her, she delivered a boy. Whoever saw such things as these? Can a land come to birth in one day? Can a nation be born all at once? Yet as soon as birth pangs came, Zion bore her children. Will I, who create life, close the womb? says your God. all you who love her! Rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her, from her comforting breasts, that you may drink and be refreshed from her full breasts. Look, I&quot;m extending prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream. You will nurse and be carried on the hip and bounced upon the knee. so I will comfort you; in Jerusalem you will be comforted. your entire being will flourish like grass. The LORD &quot;s power will be known among his servants, but his fury among his enemies. God&quot;s chariots like a windstorm, to repay in hot anger, to rebuke with fiery flames. many will be slain by the LORD . so your descendants and your name will endure. all humanity will come to worship me, says the LORD . of the people who rebelled against me, where their worm never dies, where their fire is never extinguished. They will be a horror to everyone."
