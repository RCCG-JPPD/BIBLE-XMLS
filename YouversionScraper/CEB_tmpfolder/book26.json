They made your hull, inlaid with ivory, of boxwood from the coasts of Cyprus. it became your emblem. Your awning was made of blue and purple cloth from the coasts of Elishah. You were filled to capacity and heavily laden in the middle of the sea. an east wind sank you into the sea&quot;s depths. your sailors, your helmsmen, those patching your leaks, your merchants, all your warriors in you, and all the company that is with you&ndash; they also sank into the sea&quot;s depth on the day of your demise. the troubled waters seethe. All sailors and helmsmen seek footing on the shore. bitterly they wail, and they put dust on their heads and cover themselves with ashes. and put on mourning clothes. In despair they weep for you, and bitterly perform the mourning rites. they sing lamentions over you: &apos;Who was like Tyre, silenced in the middle of the sea?&apos; you satisfied many people. Your abundant wealth and merchandise enriched the kings of the earth. your cargoes, as well as everyone in your company, are sunk into the water&quot;s depths. shudder on account of you.
