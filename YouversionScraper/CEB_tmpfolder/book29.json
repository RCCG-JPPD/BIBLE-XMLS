What the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten. And what the hopping locust left, Scream over the sweet wine, all you wine drinkers, because it is snatched from your mouth; has invaded my land. Its teeth are like lions&quot; teeth; its fangs are like those of a lioness. splintered my fig trees, stripped off their bark and thrown it down; their branches have turned white. one who has lost the husband of her youth. The priests and the LORD &quot;s ministers mourn. the ground mourns; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine dries up, the olive oil fails. howl, you vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley, for the crops of the field are destroyed. the fig tree withers. Pomegranate, palm, and apple&ndash; all the trees of the field are dried up. lament, ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in funeral clothing, servants of my God, because the grain offering and the drink offering have gone from the temple of your God. request a special assembly. Gather the elders and all the land&quot;s people to the temple of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD . The day of the LORD is near; right before our eyes? Aren&quot;t joy and gladness also gone from our God&quot;s house? the barns are empty. The granaries are in ruin because the grain has dried up. Herds of cattle are in distress because there is no pasture for them; even the flocks of sheep pant. for fire has completely destroyed the pastures of the wilderness; and flames have burned all the trees of the field. because the streams have dried up; the fire has completely destroyed the meadows of the wilderness."
