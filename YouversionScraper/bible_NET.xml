		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and colaborer,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love, for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love â€“ I, Paul, an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus â€“</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">I am appealing to you concerning my child, whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment, that is, Onesimus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you and me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">I have sent him (who is my very heart) back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">I wanted to keep him so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14">However, without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion, but from your own willingness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15">For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16">no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a dear brother. He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17">Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18">Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19">I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20">Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21">Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22">At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25">May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="63" bname="2  John">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1">From the elder, to an elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth (and not I alone, but also all those who know the truth),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2">because of the truth that resides in us and will be with us forever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3">Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4">I rejoiced greatly because I have found some of your children living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5">But now I ask you, lady (not as if I were writing a new commandment to you, but the one we have had from the beginning), that we love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6">(Now this is love: that we walk according to his commandments.) This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning; thus you should walk in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, people who do not confess Jesus as Christ coming in the flesh. This person is the deceiver and the antichrist!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8">Watch out, so that you do not lose the things we have worked for, but receive a full reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone who goes on ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one who remains in this teaching has both the Father and the Son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10">If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not give him any greeting,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11">because the person who gives him a greeting shares in his evil deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12">Though I have many other things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come visit you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13">The children of your elect sister greet you.</VERS>
