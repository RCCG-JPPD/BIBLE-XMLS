And here&quot;s why: This whole country has become a whorehouse, unfaithful to me, God .&apos; &apos;Name him Jezreel. It won&quot;t be long now before I&quot;ll make the people of Israel pay for the massacre at Jezreel. I&quot;m calling it quits on the kingdom of Israel. Payday is coming! I&quot;m going to chop Israel&quot;s bows and arrows into kindling in the valley of Jezreel.&apos; * * * &apos;Name this one No-Mercy. I&quot;m fed up with Israel. I&quot;ve run out of mercy. There&quot;s no more forgiveness. Judah&quot;s another story. I&quot;ll continue having mercy on them. I&quot;ll save them. It will be their God who saves them, Not their armaments and armies, not their horsepower and manpower.&apos; * * * &apos;Name him Nobody. You&quot;ve become nobodies to me, and I, God , am a nobody to you."

Tell her to quit dressing like a whore, displaying her breasts for sale. If she refuses, I&quot;ll rip off her clothes and expose her, naked as a newborn. I&quot;ll turn her skin into dried-out leather, her body into a badlands landscape, a rack of bones in the desert. I&quot;ll have nothing to do with her children, born one and all in a whorehouse. Face it: Your mother&quot;s been a whore, bringing bastard children into the world. She said, &quot;I&quot;m off to see my lovers! They&quot;ll wine and dine me, Dress and caress me, perfume and adorn me!&quot; But I&quot;ll fix her: I&quot;ll dump her in a field of thistles, then lose her in a dead-end alley. She&quot;ll go on the hunt for her lovers but not bring down a single one. She&quot;ll look high and low but won&quot;t find a one. Then she&quot;ll say, &quot;I&quot;m going back to my husband, the one I started out with. That was a better life by far than this one.&quot; She didn&quot;t know that it was I all along who wined and dined and adorned her, That I was the one who dressed her up in the big-city fashions and jewelry that she wasted on wild Baal-orgies. I&quot;m about to bring her up short: No more wining and dining! Silk lingerie and gowns are a thing of the past. I&quot;ll expose her genitals to the public. All her fly-by-night lovers will be helpless to help her. Party time is over. I&quot;m calling a halt to the whole business, her wild weekends and unholy holidays. I&quot;ll wreck her sumptuous gardens and ornamental fountains, of which she bragged, &quot;Whoring paid for all this!&quot; They will soon be dumping grounds for garbage, feeding grounds for stray dogs and cats. I&quot;ll make her pay for her indulgence in promiscuous religion&ndash; all that sensuous Baal worship And all the promiscuous sex that went with it, stalking her lovers, dressed to kill, And not a thought for me.&apos; God &quot;s Message! I&quot;m going to start all over again. I&quot;m taking her back out into the wilderness where we had our first date, and I&quot;ll court her. I&quot;ll give her bouquets of roses. I&quot;ll turn Heartbreak Valley into Acres of Hope. She&quot;ll respond like she did as a young girl, those days when she was fresh out of Egypt. * * * &apos;you&quot;ll address me, &quot;Dear husband!&quot; Never again will you address me, &quot;My slave-master!&quot; I&quot;ll wash your mouth out with soap, get rid of all the dirty false-god names, not so much as a whisper of those names again. At the same time I&quot;ll make a peace treaty between you and wild animals and birds and reptiles, And get rid of all weapons of war. Think of it! Safe from beasts and bullies! And then I&quot;ll marry you for good&ndash;forever! I&quot;ll marry you true and proper, in love and tenderness. Yes, I&quot;ll marry you and neither leave you nor let you go. You&quot;ll know me, God , for who I really am. * * * &apos;I&quot;ll answer the sky, sky will answer earth, Earth will answer grain and wine and olive oil, and they&quot;ll all answer Jezreel. I&quot;ll plant her in the good earth. I&quot;ll have mercy on No-Mercy. I&quot;ll say to Nobody, &quot;You&quot;re my dear Somebody,&quot; and he&quot;ll say &quot;You&quot;re my God!&quot;&apos;"
