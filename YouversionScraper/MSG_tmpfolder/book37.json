Think it over. You have spent a lot of money, but you haven&quot;t much to show for it. You keep filling your plates, but you never get filled up. You keep drinking and drinking and drinking, but you&quot;re always thirsty. You put on layer after layer of clothes, but you can&quot;t get warm. And the people who work for you, what are they getting out of it? Not much&ndash; a leaky, rusted-out bucket, that&quot;s what.&apos; &apos;Take a good, hard look at your life. Think it over.&apos; * * * &apos;Here&quot;s what I want you to do: Climb into the hills and cut some timber. Bring it down and rebuild the Temple. Do it just for me. Honor me. You&quot;ve had great ambitions for yourselves, but nothing has come of it. The little you have brought to my Temple I&quot;ve blown away&ndash;there was nothing to it. * * *"
