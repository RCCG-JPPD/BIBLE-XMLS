What&quot;s there to show for a lifetime of work, a lifetime of working your fingers to the bone? One generation goes its way, the next one arrives, but nothing changes&ndash;it&quot;s business as usual for old planet earth. The sun comes up and the sun goes down, then does it again, and again&ndash;the same old round. The wind blows south, the wind blows north. Around and around and around it blows, blowing this way, then that&ndash;the whirling, erratic wind. All the rivers flow into the sea, but the sea never fills up. The rivers keep flowing to the same old place, and then start all over and do it again. Everything&quot;s boring, utterly boring&ndash; no one can find any meaning in it. Boring to the eye, boring to the ear. What was will be again, what happened will happen again. There&quot;s nothing new on this earth. Year after year it&quot;s the same old thing. Does someone call out, &apos;Hey, this is new&apos;? Don&quot;t get excited&ndash;it&quot;s the same old story. Nobody remembers what happened yesterday. And the things that will happen tomorrow? Nobody&quot;ll remember them either. Don&quot;t count on being remembered. A minus that won&quot;t add up. The more you know, the more you hurt."
