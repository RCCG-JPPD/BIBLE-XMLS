It came during the reign of Josiah son of Amon, who was king of Judah: a thorough housecleaning.&apos; God &quot;s Decree. including birds and fish&ndash; Anything and everything that causes sin&ndash;will go, but especially people. * * * and everybody who lives in Jerusalem. I&quot;ll sweep the place clean of every trace of the sex-and-religion Baal shrines and their priests. I&quot;ll get rid of the people who sneak up to their rooftops at night to worship the star gods and goddesses; Also those who continue to worship God but cover their bases by worshiping other king-gods as well; Not to mention those who&quot;ve dumped God altogether, no longer giving him a thought or offering a prayer. * * * Reverent silence before me, God , the Master! Time&quot;s up. My Judgment Day is near: The Holy Day is all set, the invited guests made holy. On the Holy Day, God &quot;s Judgment Day, I will punish the leaders and the royal sons; I will punish those who dress up like foreign priests and priestesses, Who introduce pagan prayers and practices; And I&quot;ll punish all who import pagan superstitions that turn holy places into hellholes. Judgment Day!&apos; God &quot;s Decree! &apos;Cries of panic from the city&quot;s Fish Gate, Cries of terror from the city&quot;s Second Quarter, sounds of great crashing from the hills! Wail, you shopkeepers on Market Street! Moneymaking has had its day. The god Money is dead. On Judgment Day, I&quot;ll search through every closet and alley in Jerusalem. I&quot;ll find and punish those who are sitting it out, fat and lazy, amusing themselves and taking it easy, Who think, &quot; God doesn&quot;t do anything, good or bad. He isn&quot;t involved, so neither are we.&quot; But just wait. They&quot;ll lose everything they have, money and house and land. They&quot;ll build a house and never move in. They&quot;ll plant vineyards and never taste the wine. It&quot;s countdown time: . . . seven, six, five, four . . . Bitter and noisy cries on my Judgment Day, even strong men screaming for help. Judgment Day is payday&ndash;my anger paid out: a day of distress and anguish, a day of catastrophic doom, a day of darkness at noon, a day of black storm clouds, a day of bloodcurdling war cries, as forts are assaulted, as defenses are smashed. I&quot;ll make things so bad they won&quot;t know what hit them. They&quot;ll walk around groping like the blind. They&quot;ve sinned against God ! Their blood will be poured out like old dishwater, their guts shoveled into slop buckets. Don&quot;t plan on buying your way out. Your money is worthless for this. This is the Day of God &quot;s Judgment&ndash;my wrath ! I care about sin with fiery passion&ndash; A fire to burn up the corrupted world, a wildfire finish to the corrupting people.&apos;"
