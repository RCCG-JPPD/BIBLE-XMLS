1: What delight comes to the one who follows God&quot;s ways!  He won&quot;t walk in step with the wicked, nor share the sinner&quot;s way, nor be found sitting in the scorner&quot;s seat. deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of life. He is never dry, never fainting, for God will not defend them. Nothing they do will succeed or endure for long, for they have no part with those who walk in truth. The Lord embraces their paths as they move forward while the way of the wicked leads only to doom.
2: His passion is to remain true to the Word of &apos;I AM,&apos;  meditating day and night on the true revelation of light. planted by God&quot;s design, ever blessed, ever prosperous. They are like chaff blown away by the wind.
3: He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree
4: But how different are the wicked.
5: The wicked will not endure the day of judgment,
6: But how different it is for the righteous!
