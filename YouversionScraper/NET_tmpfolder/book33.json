Samaria epitomizes their rebellion! Where are Judah’s pagan worship centers, you ask? They are right in Jerusalem! vineyards will be planted there! I will tumble the rubble of her stone walls down into the valley, and tear down her fortifications to their foundations. all her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire. I will make a waste heap of all her images. Since she gathered the metal as a prostitute collects her wages, the idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.” I will walk around barefoot and without my outer garments. I will howl like a wild dog, and screech like an owl. It has infected Judah; it has spread to the leadership of my people and has even contaminated Jerusalem! Don’t shed even a single tear!

It is wise to respect your authority, O Lord ! Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city! or the smaller-than-standard measure I hate so much. or a bag of deceptive weights. her inhabitants lie, their tongues speak deceptive words. Even if you have the strength to overtake some prey, you will not be able to carry it away; you will squeeze oil from the olives, but you will have no oil to rub on your bodies; you will squeeze juice from the grapes, but you will have no wine to drink. and all the practices of Ahab’s dynasty; you follow their policies. Therefore I will make you an appalling sight, the city’s inhabitants will be taunted derisively, and nations will mock all of you.”"
