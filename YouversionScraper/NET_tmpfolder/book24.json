Announce along the Arnon River that Moab has been destroyed.&quot; until others treat him as a laughingstock. Go and live in the cliffs. Be like a dove that makes its nest I know how haughty they are. I have heard how arrogant, proud, and haughty they are, But their pride is ill-founded. I will cry out in sadness for all of Moab. The destroyer will ravage I will stop the flow of wine from the winepresses. The shouts there will be shouts of soldiers, They will be sounded from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. For even the waters of Nimrim will be dried up. I will put an end to those who sacrifice to other gods. like a flute playing a funeral song. Yes, like a flute playing a funeral song, my heart moans for the people of Kir Heres. For the wealth they have gained will perish. They will all cut off their beards to show their sorrow. They will all make gashes in their hands. and in all its public squares there will be nothing but mourning. For I will break Moab like an unwanted jar. Oh, how her people will wail! Moab will become an object of ridicule, a terrifying sight to all the nations that surround her.&apos; &apos;Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings Her fortresses will be taken. At that time the soldiers of Moab will be frightened because she has vaunted herself against the Lord . will fall into a pit. Anyone who climbs out of the pit For the time is coming those trying to escape will stand helpless. For a fire will burst forth from Heshbon. Flames will shoot out from the former territory of Sihon. They will burn the foreheads of the people of Moab, You people who worship Chemosh will be destroyed. Your sons will be taken away captive. The judgment against Moab ends here."

Their shepherds have allow them to go astray. They have roamed from one mountain and hill to another. For those people have sinned against the Lord , their true pasture. They have sinned against the Lord in whom their ancestors trusted.&quot; Leave the land of Babylonia! Be the first to depart! a host of mighty nations from the land of the north.

Your joyous sounds are like the neighs of a stallion. The land where you were born will be disgraced. Indeed, Babylonia will become the least important of all nations. because of all the disasters that have happened to it. all you soldiers who are armed with bows. Shoot all your arrows at her! Do not hold any back! She will throw up her hands in surrender. Her towers will fall.

I have brought out the weapons for carrying out my wrath. For I, the Lord God who rules over all, have work to carry out in the land of Babylonia. Pile her up in ruins! Destroy her completely! Do not leave anyone alive! Let them be slaughtered! They are doomed, for their day of reckoning has come, getting revenge for what they have done to his temple.

No one will dwell there for all time to come. No one will live there. says the Lord . A mighty nation and many kings are stirring into action they are coming against you, fair Babylon! when he hears news of their coming. agony like that of a woman giving birth to a baby. what I intend to do to the people who inhabit the land of Babylonia. Her cries of anguish will be heard by the other nations.&apos; Declare the news! Do not hide it! Say: &quot;Babylon will be captured. Marduk will be dismayed. Babylon&quot;s idols will be put to shame. It will lay her land waste. People and animals will flee out of it. No one will inhabit it.&quot; &apos;the people of Israel and Judah will return to the land together. They will come back with tears of repentance they will turn their faces toward it.

Be like the male goats that lead the herd. They will set up their battle lines against her. Those who plunder it will take all they want,&apos; That made you happy and glad. It will become a dry and barren desert. It will be totally desolate. All who pass by will be filled with horror and will hiss out their scorn For she has sinned against the Lord . Her walls will be torn down. take out your vengeance on her! Do to her as she has done! Let all the foreigners return to their own people. Let them hurry back to their own lands which lions have chased away. &quot;I will punish the king of Babylon and his land just as I punished the king of Assyria. They will graze on Mount Carmel and the land of Bashan. no guilt will be found in Israel. There is the sound of great destruction. See what an object of horror Babylon has become among the nations! you were caught before you knew it. You fought against me. Open up the places where she stores her grain! the time for them to be punished.&apos; They are coming to Zion to declare there how the Lord our God is getting revenge, Summon against her all who draw the bow! Set up camp all around the city! Do not allow anyone to escape! Pay her back for what she has done. Do to her what she has done to others. All her soldiers will be destroyed at that time,&apos; no one will help you get up. I will set fire to your towns; &apos;The people of Israel are oppressed. All those who took them captive are holding them prisoners. They refuse to set them free. &apos;They will come against the people who inhabit Babylonia, against her leaders and her men of wisdom. Destructive forces will come against her soldiers; Destructive forces will come against her treasures; they will be taken away as plunder! But no people will ever live there again. Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns. No human being will settle in it,&apos; in faraway parts of the earth. They are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride forth on their horses. Lined up in formation like men going into battle, Anguish will grip him, scatters the sheep in the pastureland around it. So too I will chase the Babylonians off of their land. Then I will appoint over it whomever I choose. For there is no one like me. There is no one who can call me to account. There is no ruler that can stand up against me. Their little ones will be dragged off. I will completely destroy their land because of what they have done."

For the Lord will carry out his plan. They will remain in their fortified cities. The houses in her cities will be set on fire. They will bring news to the king of Babylon the reed marshes have been burned, which has been trampled flat for harvest. The time for her to be cut down and harvested devoured me and drove my people out. Like a monster from the deep he swallowed me. He filled his belly with my riches. He made me an empty dish. &apos;May Babylon pay for the violence done to me and to my relatives.&apos; Jerusalem says, &apos;I will stand up for your cause. I will dry up their sea. It will become an object of horror and of hissing scorn, I will set out a banquet for them. I will make them drunk they will fall asleep forever, See how the pride of the whole earth has been taken! See what an object of horror She has become a dry and barren desert. No one lives in those towns any more. I will make him spit out what he has swallowed. The nations will not come streaming to him any longer. Flee to save your lives because of the reports that are heard in the land. For a report will come in one year. Another report will follow it in the next. There will be violence in the land with ruler fighting against ruler.&apos; when I will punish the idols of Babylon. Her whole land will be put to shame. will sing for joy over Babylon. For destroyers from the north will attack it,&apos; just as the earth&quot;s mortally wounded fell Remember the Lord in a faraway land. For foreigners have invaded &apos;when I will punish her idols. Throughout her land the mortally wounded will groan. the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians. and put an end to her loud noise. Her warriors will be captured; Her high gates will be set on fire."
