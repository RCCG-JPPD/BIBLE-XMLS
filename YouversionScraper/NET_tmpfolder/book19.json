O Lord my God, you are magnificent. and travels along on the wings of the wind. and the flaming fire his attendant. the waters reached above the mountains. to the place you appointed for them. so that they would not cover the earth again. they chirp among the bushes. the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow. and crops for people to cultivate, so they can produce food from the ground, and so they can have oil to make their faces shine, as well as food that sustains people&quot;s lives. near the evergreens in which the herons live. and the sun sets according to a regular schedule. seeking their food from God. and sleep in their dens. and labor away until evening. You have exhibited great skill in making all of them; which teems with innumerable swimming creatures, and over here swims the whale you made to play in it. to provide them with food on a regular basis. you open your hand and they are filled with food. May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made! I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist! You are robed in splendor and majesty. He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain, He makes the clouds his chariot, it will never be upended. at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off &ndash; and the valleys went down &ndash; they flow between the mountains. the wild donkeys quench their thirst. the cedars of Lebanon which he planted, the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs. during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around. the earth is full of the living things you have made. living things both small and large. When you take away their life&quot;s breath, they die and return to dust. and you replenish the surface of the ground. he touches the mountains and they start to smolder. I will rejoice in the Lord . and the wicked vanish! Praise the Lord , O my soul! Praise the Lord !"
