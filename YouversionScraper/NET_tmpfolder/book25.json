The princess who once ruled the provinces has become a forced laborer! tears stream down her cheeks. among all her lovers. under affliction and harsh oppression. She lives among the nations; in narrow straits. because no one travels to the festivals. All her city gates are deserted; her priests groan. Her virgins grieve; she is in bitter anguish! her enemies are at ease. because of her many acts of rebellion. captive before the enemy. has departed. so they were too exhausted to escape from the hunter. when she became a poor homeless person, that she owned in days of old. When her people fell into an enemy&quot;s grip, none of her allies came to her rescue. Her enemies gloated over her; they sneered at her downfall. therefore she became an object of scorn. All who admired her have despised her because they have seen her nakedness. She groans aloud and turns away in shame. she did not consider the consequences of her sin. Her demise was astonishing, She cried, &apos;Look, O Lord , on my affliction because my enemy boasts!&apos; all her valuables. Indeed she watched in horror as Gentiles invaded her holy temple &ndash; those whom you had commanded: &apos;They must not enter your assembly place.&apos; as they searched for a morsel of bread. They exchanged their valuables for just enough food to stay alive. &apos;Look, O Lord ! Consider The Lord has afflicted me, he has inflicted it on me when he burned with anger. into my bones, and it overcame them. He spread out a trapper&quot;s net for my feet; He has placed his yoke on my neck; he has sapped my strength. The Lord has handed me over The Lord did this in my midst. He summoned an assembly against me The Lord has stomped like grapes the virgin daughter, Judah. my eyes flow with tears. For there is no one in sight who can comfort me or encourage me. My children are desolated his neighbors have become his enemies. like filthy garbage in their midst. Yes, I rebelled against his commands. Please listen, all you nations, Truly they had searched for food to keep themselves alive. my stomach is in knots! My heart is pounding inside me. Yes, I was terribly rebellious! Out in the street the sword bereaves a mother of her children; Inside the house death is present. they are glad that you have brought it about. Bring about the day of judgment that you promised so that they may end up like me! afflict them just as you have afflicted me because of all my acts of rebellion. and my heart is sick with sorrow. \u00d7\u2018 ( Bet ) She has no one to comfort her All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies. \u00d7\u2019 ( Gimel ) she has found no resting place.
