For the Lord has decreed this judgment. the prominent people of the earth fade away. disregarded the regulation, and broken the permanent treaty. its inhabitants pay for their guilt. This is why the inhabitants of the earth disappear, and are reduced to just a handful of people. all those who like to celebrate groan. all of the houses are shut up tight. all joy turns to sorrow; celebrations disappear from the earth. the gate is reduced to rubble. and just a few olives are left at the end of the harvest. they praise the majesty of the Lord in the west. along the seacoasts extol the fame of the Lord God of Israel. the Just One is majestic. But I say, “I’m wasting away! I’m wasting away! I’m doomed! Deceivers deceive, deceivers thoroughly deceive!” are ready to overtake you inhabitants of the earth! will fall into the pit; For the floodgates of the heavens are opened up the earth shakes violently. it will sway back and forth like a hut in a windstorm. the heavenly forces in the heavens and after staying there for a long time, they will be punished. the bright sun will be darkened; for the Lord who commands armies will rule on Mount Zion in Jerusalem in the presence of his assembly, in majestic splendor."

I am the one; I am present at the very beginning my right hand spread out the sky. I summon them; they stand together. yes, I have summoned him; From the very first I have not spoken in secret; “I am the Lord your God, who teaches you how to succeed, who leads you in the way you should go. Their name would not have been cut off Flee from the Babylonians! Announce it with a shout of joy! Make this known! he makes water flow out of a rock for them; and are descended from Judah, and invoke the God of Israel – but not in an honest and just manner. they trust in the God of Israel, I issued the decrees and made the predictions; and your forehead like bronze. Will you not admit that what I say is true? that are previously unrevealed and you do not know about. ‘Yes, I know about them.’ you were not told beforehand. For I know that you are very deceitful; you were labeled a rebel from birth. for the sake of my prestige I restrain myself from destroying you. I have purified you in the furnace of misery. for how can I allow my name to be defiled? I will not share my glory with anyone else! and at the very end. Who among them announced these things? The Lord ’s ally will carry out his desire against Babylon; he will exert his power against the Babylonians. I lead him and he will succeed. when it happens, I am there.” So now, the sovereign Lord has sent me, accompanied by his spirit. the Holy One of Israel: prosperity would have flowed to you like a river, deliverance would have come to you like the waves of the sea. and your children like its granules. and eliminated from my presence. Proclaim it throughout the earth! Say, ‘The Lord protects his servant Jacob. he splits open a rock and water flows out.’"
