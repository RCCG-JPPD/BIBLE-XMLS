There will be a bitter sound on the Lord ’s day of judgment; a day of distress and hardship, a day of devastation and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and dark skies, for they have sinned against the Lord . Their blood will be poured out like dirt; in the day of the Lord ’s angry judgment. (The idolatrous images of these creatures will be destroyed along with evil people.) I will remove humanity from the face of the earth,” says the Lord . and all who live in Jerusalem. I will remove from this place every trace of Baal worship, as well as the very memory of the pagan priests. those who swear allegiance to the Lord while taking oaths in the name of their ‘king,’ and do not want the Lord ’s help or guidance.” for the Lord ’s day of judgment is almost here. The Lord has prepared a sacrificial meal; he has ritually purified his guests. I will punish the princes and the king’s sons, and all who wear foreign styles of clothing. who fill the house of their master with wealth taken by violence and deceit. “a loud cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the city’s newer district, and a loud crash from the hills. for all the merchants will disappear and those who count money will be removed. I will punish the people who are entrenched in their sin, those who think to themselves, ‘The Lord neither rewards nor punishes.’ at that time warriors will cry out in battle. Judgment will fall on the fortified cities and the high corner towers. and they will stumble like blind men, their flesh will be scattered like manure. The whole earth will be consumed by his fiery wrath. Indeed, he will bring terrifying destruction on all who live on the earth.”"
