He heard my cry for help. The foundations of the mountains trembled. They shook because he was angry. Burning flames came from his mouth. Red-hot coals fell from him. He stood on a thick, dark cloud. racing on the wings of the wind. He was hidden by dark clouds heavy with water. hail broke through the clouds with flashes of lightning. the lightning bolts that threw them into confusion. Then the bottom of the sea could be seen, and the earth&quot;s foundations were uncovered. He pulled me from the deep water. They were too strong for me, so he saved me. but the Lord was there to support me. He took me to a safe place. He was good to me because I am innocent. I have not turned against my God. I never rejected his rules. I have kept myself from sinning. He could see that I am innocent. You are good to those who are good. But you outsmart the wicked, no matter how clever they are. but you humiliate the proud. You, God, turn the darkness around me into light. If my God is with me, I can climb over enemy walls. The Lord&quot;s promise always proves to be true. He protects those who trust in him. There is no Rock except our God. He clears the path I need to take. Even on steep mountains he keeps me from falling. so that my arms can bend the most powerful bow. You support me with your right hand. It is your help that has made me great. so that I could walk without stumbling. I did not stop until they were destroyed. They fell under my feet. You made my enemies fall before me. I destroyed those who hated me. but there was no one to save them. They cried out to the Lord, but he did not answer them. I smashed them like mud in the streets. You made me the ruler over nations. People I never knew now serve me. Those foreigners fall helpless before me! and come out of their hiding places shaking with fear. I praise my Rock, the God who saves me. How great he is! the one who puts people under my control. You, Lord, help me defeat those who attack me. You save me from cruel people. That is why I sing songs of praise to your name. to David and his descendants forever."

And they would be able to teach it to their own children. never forgetting what he had done and always obeying his commands. who were stubborn and refused to obey. Their hearts were not devoted to God, and they were not faithful to him. but they ran from the battle. They refused to obey his teachings. and the amazing things he had shown them. he showed his great power at Zoan in Egypt. The water stood like a solid wall on both sides of them. and each night he led them with the light from the column of fire. and gave them an ocean of fresh water. and made it flow like a river! They rebelled against God Most High in the desert. by telling him to give them the food they wanted. &apos;Can God give us food in the desert? But can he give us bread and meat?&apos; and became angry with Jacob&quot;s people. He was angry with Israel, They did not believe that God could save them. and manna rained down on them for food. It was as if doors in the sky opened, and grain poured down from a storehouse in the sky. God sent plenty of food to satisfy them. and by his power he made the south wind blow. There were so many birds that they were like sand on the seashore. all around their tents. God had given them what they wanted. while the food was still in their mouths, He brought down Israel&quot;s best young men. They did not trust in the amazing things God could do. he brought their years to a close with disaster. They would come running back to God. They would remember that God Most High had saved them. they told him lies. They were not faithful to the agreement he gave them. He forgave their sins and did not destroy them. Many times he held back his anger. He never let it get out of control. like a wind that blows and then is gone. They made him so sad. They really hurt the Holy One of Israel. They forgot the many times he saved them from the enemy. the miracles in the fields of Zoan. and the Egyptians could not drink the water. He sent the frogs that ruined their lives. and their other plants to locusts. and their trees with sleet. and their cattle with lightning. He sent his destroying angels against them. He did not spare their lives. He let them die with a deadly disease. He led his people like sheep into the desert. They had nothing to fear. He drowned their enemies in the sea. to the mountain he took with his own power. and gave each family its share of the land. He gave each tribe of Israel a place to live. They didn&quot;t obey his commands. They changed directions like a boomerang. They built statues of false gods and made him jealous. So he rejected Israel completely! the Holy Tent where he lived among the people. the symbol of his power and glory. and let them be killed in war. and there were no wedding songs for their young women. but the widows had no time to mourn for them. like a man waking from his sleep, like a soldier after drinking too much wine. He brought them shame that will last forever. He did not accept Ephraim&quot;s family. and he chose Mount Zion, the place he loves. Like the earth, God built his Temple to last forever. He took him from the sheep pens. and gave him the job of caring for the descendants of Jacob&ndash;Israel, his chosen people. and guided them very wisely."

None of the &apos;gods&apos; can compare to the Lord. they fear and respect him; he is more awesome than all those around him. You are strong, Lord, and always faithful. You can calm its angry waves. You scattered your enemies with your own powerful arm. You made the world and everything in it. Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon sing praises to your name. Your power is great! Victory is yours! Love and faithfulness are servants before your throne. They live in the light of your kindness. They praise your goodness. Their power comes from you. who is the Holy One of Israel. &apos;I have made a young soldier strong. From among my people I chose him for an important position. and anointed him as king with my special oil. and my arm will make him strong. The wicked will never defeat him. I will defeat those who hate him. I will always make him strong. He will control the rivers. You are my God, my Rock, my Savior.&quot; He will be the great king on earth. My agreement with him will never end. His kingdom will last as long as the skies. and stop obeying my commands, and ignore my commands, for their sins and wrongs. I will never stop being loyal to him. I will never change what I said. and I would not lie to David. His kingdom will last as long as the sun. The sky is a witness to the agreement that can be trusted.&apos; Selah and you have left him all alone. You threw the king&quot;s crown into the dirt. You destroyed all his fortresses. His neighbors laugh at him. and let his enemies win the war. You did not help your king win the battle. You threw his throne to the ground. You shamed him. Selah Will you ignore us forever? Will your anger burn like a fire forever? You created us to live a short life and then die. Will anyone escape the grave? Selah You promised David that you would be loyal to his family. Lord, I had to listen to all the insults from your enemies. They insulted your chosen king wherever he went. Amen and Amen!"

I wish the wicked would be gone forever. My soul, praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!"

Then the ground closed up and covered Abiram&quot;s group. It burned those wicked people. They worshiped a statue! for a statue of a grass-eating bull! the one who did the miracles in Egypt. He did awesome things at the Red Sea! but Moses, the leader he chose, stood in the way. God was very angry, but Moses begged him to stop, They did not believe that God would help them defeat the people there. and refused to obey the Lord. in the desert. and to let other people defeat their descendants. so he made them sick. and God stopped the sickness. and it will be remembered forever and ever. and created trouble for Moses. and he spoke without stopping to think. But the Israelites did not obey him. and did what those people were doing. And their idols became a trap. as sacrifices to demons. and offered them to the false gods of Canaan. So the land was polluted with the sin of murder. and they became dirty with the sins of other nations. He rejected those who belonged to him. and let their enemies rule over them. and made life hard for them. but they turned against him and did what they wanted to do. His people did many bad things. he listened to their prayers. and because of his faithful love, he comforted them. but the Lord caused them to be kind to his people.

Don&quot;t let evil rule over me. and I will obey your instructions. and teach me your laws. because people don&quot;t obey your teachings. and your decisions are fair. We can trust them completely. that my enemies ignore your commands. Time and again it has been proven true. But I have not forgotten your instructions. and your teachings can be trusted. your commands give me joy. Help me understand them so that I can live. Answer me, and I will obey your laws. Save me, and I will obey your rules. I trust what you say. to think about your word. Lord, you always do what is right, so let me live. They live far away from your teachings. and all your commands can be trusted. that you made them to last forever. I have not forgotten your teachings. Let me live, as you promised. because they don&quot;t follow your laws. You always do what is right, so let me live. but I have not stopped following your rules. because they refuse to do what you say. Lord, I know your love is true, so let me live. Your laws are fair and will last forever. but the only thing I fear is your command. like someone who has found a great treasure. But I love your teachings. because your laws are fair. Nothing can make them fall. I obey your commands. I love them very much. because you know everything I do. Make me wise, as you promised. Save me, as you promised. because you have taught me your laws. because all your commands are good. so reach out and help me! Your teachings make me happy. Let me find the help I need in your laws. Come and find me. I am your servant, and I have not forgotten your commands."
