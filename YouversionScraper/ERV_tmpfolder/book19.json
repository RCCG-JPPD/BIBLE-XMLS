When I do, I’m safe and sound in you— delivered from my foes! taking me to death’s door, and from your temple-throne you heard my troubled cry, It reeled and rocked before him. As the mountains trembled, they melted away, for his anger was kindled on my behalf! erupting with blazing, burning coals as smoke and fire encircled him. Swiftly he rode to earth as the stormy sky was lowered. He rode a chariot of thunderclouds amidst thick darkness; his steed was a cherub, soaring on outstretched wings of Spirit-Wind. his thunder-tabernacle surrounded him. He hid himself in mystery-darkness; the dense rain clouds were his garments. with lightning bolts and hail— a tempest dropping coals of fire. spoke with his thunder-voice from the sky. The Most High uttered his voice! See how they ran and scattered in fear! uncovering the secret source of the sea. The hidden depths of land and sea were exposed by the blast of his hot breath. and drew me to himself! you were good to deliver me. but the Lord held on to me. I’ll not sin by ceasing to follow him, no matter what. and I’ve obeyed everything that he’s told me to do. keeping my heart pure. because I kept my heart clean before his eyes. And to those who are loyal to you, you love to prove that you are loyal and true. But you’ll outwit the crooked and cunning with your craftiness. but the proud and haughty you disregard. You are the revelation-light in my darkness, and in your brightness I can see the path ahead. All Yahweh’s promises have proven true. What a secure shelter for all those who turn to hide themselves in you, and made my way perfect. my arms can bend a bow of bronze. Your power within makes me strong to subdue. By stooping down in gentleness, you made me great! ready to fight some more ! and didn’t turn back until the war was won! I finished them once and for all; they’re as good as dead. and made my enemies bow low at my feet. for through you I’ve destroyed them all! They cried out to Yahweh, but he refused to answer them. I swept them away like dirt on the floor. for you make me a leader of nations. Even those I’ve never heard of come and bow at my feet. Even the rebel foreigners obey my every word. trembling in their strongholds, they come crawling out of their hideouts, cringing in fear before me. Praise is lifted high to the unshakable God! Towering over all, my Savior-God is worthy to be praised! subduing all who come against me. he lifts me up high and keeps me out of reach, far from the grasp of my violent foe. I will sing my song to the highest God, You’ve always been tender and kind to me, your anointed one, your loving servant, David, and to all my descendants!"

Everybody knows what you can do for those who turn and hide themselves in you. in the sheltered, secret place before your face. Overshadow them with your glory-presence. Keep them from these accusations, the brutal insults of evil men. Tuck them safely away in the tabernacle where you dwell. For his marvelous miracle of mercy protected me when I was overwhelmed by my enemies. For in truth, you did hear my prayer and came to rescue me. The Lord protects and preserves all those who are loyal to him. But he pays back in full all those who reject him in their pride. Wait for him to break through for you, all who trust in him!"

We will continue to tell our children and not hide from the rising generation the great marvels of our God— his miracles and power that have brought us all this far. He established decrees for Jacob and established the law in Israel, and he commanded our forefathers to teach them to their children. from one generation to the next, even to those not yet born. and not forget his wonderful works but keep his commandments. of their fickle fathers, who were a stubborn, rebellious generation and whose spirits strayed from the eternal God. They refused to love him with all their hearts. Though they were all equipped warriors, each with weapons, when the battle began they retreated and ran away in fear. they refused to trust him and move forward in faith. the waters stood at attention on either side as the people passed on through! And all through the night the fire-cloud stood as a sentry of light. and the waters flowed like a river before their very eyes. He gave them all they wanted to drink from his living springs. and their sins against God continued to be counted. asking for the food their hearts craved. demanding he prove his love by saying, “Can’t God provide for us in this barren wilderness? Will he give us food, or will he only give us water? Where’s our meal?” His anger flared up against his people. the windows of heaven poured out food, the mercy bread-manna. The grain of grace fell from the clouds. His grace gave them more than enough! and food rained down upon them; succulent quail quieted their hunger as they ate all they wanted. their provision floated down right in front of their eyes! even with their food still in their mouths, God’s fiery anger arose against them, killing the finest of their mighty men. Even when they saw God’s marvels, they refused to believe God could care for them. with nothing to show for their lives but fear and failure. but when he began to kill them, ending their lives in a moment, they came running back to God, pleading for mercy. was their strong protector, the Hero-God who would come to their rescue. they lied through their teeth to the true God of the Covenant. So quickly they wandered away from his promises, following God with their words and not their hearts! Their worship was only flattery. He covered over their sins with his love, refusing to destroy them all. Over and over he held back his anger, restraining wrath to show them mercy. frail, fragile, and short-lived, here today and gone tomorrow. How they grieved him with their grumblings. Continually they turned back from him and with redemption’s kiss he delivered them from their enemies. when they escaped from Egypt’s bondage. They forgot the judgment of the plagues that set them free. He sent hordes of frogs, ruining their lives. was flattened with blasts of hailstones, their fruit trees ruined by a killing frost. their livestock were struck with bolts of lightning. Such fury! He sent them sorrow and devastating trouble by his mighty band of destroying angels; messengers of death were dispatched against them. and did not spare their lives. He released the judgment-plagues to rage through their land. God struck down in death all the firstborn sons of Egypt— the pride and joy of each family. out of tyranny, guiding them through the wilderness like a flock. But their enemies he led into the sea. He took care of them there once and for all! staking out an inheritance, a portion for each of Israel’s tribes. provoking to anger the God Most High. They were even worse than their fathers! They became treacherous deceivers, crooked and corrupt, and worshiped false gods in the high places, bringing low the name of God with every idol they erected. No wonder he was filled with jealousy and furious with anger! and he rejected his people with disgust. abandoning the place where he had lived among them, Enemies stole the very source of Israel’s power. when they went out to battle, for his anger was intense against his very own. Their daughters never heard their wedding songs, since there was no one left to marry! before they had time to weep. as though he had been asleep. Like a mighty man he arose, roaring into action! defeating them and disgracing them for time and eternity. and Mount Zion, which he loves. strong and enduring as the earth itself. He promoted him from caring for sheep and made him his prophetic servant. and presented him before the people as the one who would love and care for them with integrity, a pure heart, and the anointing to lead Israel, his holy inheritance."

You are mindful that we’re made from dust. so swiftly fades away! like grass clippings blown away in a gust of wind, taken away to our appointment with death, leaving nothing to show that we were here. from one eternity to the other, unbroken and unrelenting toward those who fear you and those who bow facedown in awe before you. Your faithfulness to keep every gracious promise you’ve made passes from parents, to children, to grandchildren, and beyond. and keep your word. his kingdom rules the entire universe. for you are his mighty heroes who listen intently to the voice of his word to do it. ministers who serve him well and fulfill his desires. Let all his works throughout the earth, wherever his dominion stretches— let everything bless the Lord!"

You cause the grass to grow for livestock, along with the fruit, grains, and vegetables to feed mankind. You give us daily bread to sustain life, Lebanon’s lofty trees stand tall right where you planted them. a place to build their nests; even herons find a home in the cypress trees. and the rocky crag where the rock badgers burrow. and the sun to measure the days. and all the beasts of the forest come out to prowl. but it’s you, God, who feeds them all. to crouch down in the shadows. working from dawn to dusk. Wild and wonderful is this world you have made, while wisdom was there at your side. This world is full of so many creatures, yet each belongs to you! swarming with countless forms of sea life, both small and great. And look! There are the massive whales bounding upon the waves. to give them their food as you determine. feasting from your open hands, and each is satisfied from your abundant supply. they all would panic. And when you choose to take away their breath, each one dies and returns to the dust. ready to replenish life upon the earth. May the Lord take joy and pleasure in all that he has made. just a touch of his finger and volcanoes erupt as the earth shakes and melts. Every day I will sing my praises to God. for you are the source of my joy and gladness. But I will keep on praising you, my Lord, with all that is within me. My joyous, blissful shouts of “Hallelujah” are all because of you! overwhelming me by your majesty, beauty, and splendor! men and beasts have their thirst quenched because of you. Your goodness brings forth fruit for all to enjoy. giving us glowing health for our bodies."

Moses exploded in anger and spoke to them out of his bitterness. as you had commanded them. and learned to copy their works of darkness. All of this led them away from you and brought about their downfall. These dark practices greatly defiled the land and their own souls, through the murder and bloodshed of their own babies!

And then, when you heard their cry, you relented and you remembered your covenant, and you turned your heart toward them again, according to your abundant, overflowing, and limitless love. to pity them and show them compassion. Gather us from our exile and unite us together so that we will give our great and joyous thanks to you again and bring you glory by our praises. And let everyone everywhere say, “Hallelujah!” Amen!
