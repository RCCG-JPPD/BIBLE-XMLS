The Lord is the God who lives forever! He created all the faraway places on earth. He does not get tired and weary. You cannot learn all he knows. He gives power to those without it.

They choose their own ways, and they love their terrible idols. I will punish them using what they are most afraid of. I will do this because I called to them, but they did not answer. I spoke to them, but they did not listen. They did what I said is evil. They chose to do what I did not like.&apos; listen to what he says: &apos;Your brothers hated you. They turned against you because you followed me. Your brothers said, &quot;When the Lord shows his glory, then we will rejoice with you.&quot; But they will be punished.&apos; The Lord says this: &apos;I promise that if I cause you the pain of birth, I will not stop you from having your new nation.&apos; Your God said this. All of you who were sad for her, be happy and rejoice with her! like milk coming from her breast. Jerusalem&quot;s &apos;milk&apos; will satisfy you! You will drink it and enjoy her glory. &apos;Look, I will give Jerusalem peace that will flow in like a river. Wealth from all the nations will come flowing into her like a flood. And like little babies, you will drink that &quot;milk.&quot; I will hold you in my arms, and bounce you on my knees. You will be comforted in Jerusalem.&apos; You will be free and grow like grass. The Lord&quot;s servants will see his power, but his enemies will see his anger. His armies are coming with clouds of dust.
