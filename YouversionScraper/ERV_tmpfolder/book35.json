For many years the mountains stood strong, but those mountains fell to pieces. Those old, old hills fell down. God has always been able to do that. and that the houses of Midian trembled with fear. Were you angry at the streams? Were you angry at the sea? Were you angry when you rode your horses and chariots to victory? And the dry land split the rivers. The water flowed off the land. The water from the sea made a loud noise as it lost its power over the land. They stopped shining when they saw your bright flashes of lightning. That lightning was like spears and arrows shooting through the air. and punished the nations. You killed the leader in every evil family, from the least important person to stop the enemy soldiers. Those soldiers came like a powerful storm to fight against us. They thought they could defeat us easily, as robbing the poor in secret. through the deep water, stirring up the mud. My lips trembled. I felt weak deep down in my bones and stood there shaking. But I will wait patiently for destruction to come to those who attack us. and grapes might not grow on the vines. Olives might not grow on the olive trees, and food might not grow in the fields. There might not be any sheep in the pens or cattle in the barns. and rejoice in God my Savior.
