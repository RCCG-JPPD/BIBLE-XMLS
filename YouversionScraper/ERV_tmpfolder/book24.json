Bad things happened to those wicked people.&quot;&apos; This message is from the Lord. Tribes of Israel, listen. &apos;Do you think that I was not fair to your ancestors? Is that why they turned away from me? Your ancestors worshiped worthless idols, and they became worthless themselves. &quot;The Lord brought us out of Egypt. He led us through the desert, through a dry and rocky land. He led us through a dark and dangerous land. No one lives there; people don&quot;t even travel through that land. But the Lord led us through that land. So where is he now?&quot; a land filled with many good things. I did this so that you could eat the fruit and crops that grow there. But you only made my land &quot;dirty.&quot; I gave that land to you, but you made it a bad place. &quot;Where is the Lord?&quot; The people who know the law did not want to know me. The leaders of the people of Israel turned against me. They worshiped worthless idols.&apos; and I will also accuse your grandchildren. Send someone to the land of Kedar. Look very carefully. See if anyone has ever done anything like this. so that they could worship new gods? No! And their gods are not really gods at all! But my people stopped worshiping their glorious God and started worshiping idols that are worth nothing. Shake with great fear!&apos; This message is from the Lord. They turned away from me, I am the source of living water; those cisterns are broken and cannot hold water. He was not born a slave, was he? Then why did the enemy carry him away as a captive? Your cities have been burned, and no one is left in them. have smashed the top of your head. but you turned away from him. How did it help you to go to Egypt and drink from the Nile River? How did it help you to go to Assyria and drink from the Euphrates River? and that will only bring punishment to you. Trouble will come to you, and it will teach you a lesson. Think about it and understand how bad it is to turn away from the Lord your God. It is wrong not to fear and respect me.&apos; This message is from Lord GOD All-Powerful. like an ox that breaks its yoke and the ropes that held it. You said to me, &quot;I will not serve you!&quot; On every high hill and under every green tree, You were all from good seed. How did you turn into a different vine that grows bad fruit? even if you use much soap, I can still see your guilt.&apos; This message is from the Lord GOD. &quot;I am not guilty because I have not worshiped the Baal idols&quot;? Think about what you did in the valley. Think about what you have done. You are like a fast she-camel that runs from place to place. At mating time, she sniffs the wind. No one can control her when she is in heat. At mating time, every male that wants her will get her. She is easy to find. Stop wanting those other gods. But you say, &quot;It is no use! I cannot stop! I love those other gods. I can&quot;t stop chasing them.&quot; when people catch him stealing. The people of Israel should be ashamed too and so should their kings and leaders, priests and prophets. &quot;You are my father.&quot; They say to a rock, &quot;You gave birth to me.&quot; All these people will be ashamed. They don&quot;t look to me for help. They have turned their backs to me. But when the people of Judah get into trouble, they say to me, &quot;Come and save us!&quot; Let&quot;s see if they come and save you when you are in trouble! People of Judah, you have as many idols as you have cities! You have all turned against me.&apos; This message was from the Lord. but it did not help. You did not come back when you were punished. With your swords you killed the prophets who came to you. Like a dangerous lion, you killed the prophets.&apos; pay attention to the Lord&quot;s message! &apos;Have I been like a desert to the people of Israel? Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to them? My people say, &quot;We are free to go our own way. We will not come back to you!&quot; Why do they say these things? A bride does not forget to wear her wedding dress. But my people have forgotten me too many times to count. Even the worst women could learn some evil ways from you. It is the blood of poor, innocent people. You did not catch them breaking into your house. You killed them for no reason! God is not angry with me.&quot; So I will also judge you guilty of lying, because you say, &quot;I have done nothing wrong.&quot; always changing your mind. But Egypt will also disappoint you, just as Assyria did. and you will hide your face in shame. You trusted these countries, but the Lord rejected them, so they cannot help you win."

They will set up their tents all around you, and each one will let his sheep eat the grass. Get up! We will attack the city at noon. But it is already getting late. The evening shadows are growing long. Let&quot;s destroy the strong walls that are around Jerusalem.&apos; &apos;Cut down the trees around Jerusalem, This city should be punished because inside there is no justice&ndash;only slavery. so Jerusalem keeps its wickedness fresh. I hear about the robbing and violence in this city all the time. I see nothing but pain and sickness there all the time. or I will turn my back on you. I will make your land an empty desert. No one will be able to live there.&apos; Gather them the way you would gather the last grapes on a grapevine. Check each vine, like the workers check each vine when they pick the grapes.&apos; Who can I warn? Who will listen to me? The people of Israel have closed their ears, so they cannot hear my warnings. They don&quot;t like the Lord&quot;s teachings. They don&quot;t want to hear his message. and I am tired of holding it in! &apos;Pour out my anger on the children playing in the streets and on the young soldiers gathered there as well. A man and his wife will both be captured as well as all the old people. Their fields and their wives will be given to other people. I will raise my hand and punish the people of Judah.&apos; This message is from the Lord. All of them, from the least important to the most important, are like that. Even the prophets and priests tell lies. but they treat their wounds like small scratches. They say, &quot;It&quot;s all right, everything is all right.&quot; But it is not all right! but they are not ashamed at all. They don&quot;t know enough to be embarrassed by their sins. So they will be punished with everyone else. They will be thrown to the ground when I punish the people.&apos; This is what the Lord said. &apos;Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask where the old road is. Ask where the good road is, and walk on that road. If you do, you will find rest for yourselves. But you people have said, &quot;We will not walk on the good road.&quot; I told them, &quot;Listen for the sound of the war trumpet.&quot; But they said, &quot;We will not listen!&quot; I am going to bring disaster to the people of Judah because of all the evil they planned, and because they ignored my messages. They refused to obey my law. Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway country? Your burnt offerings don&quot;t make me happy. Your sacrifices don&quot;t please me.&apos; &apos;I will give the people of Judah problems. They will be like stones that make people fall. Fathers and sons will stumble over them. Friends and neighbors will die.&apos; A great nation is coming from faraway places on earth. They are cruel; they have no mercy. They are so powerful. They sound like the roaring ocean as they ride their horses. That army is coming, ready for battle. and we are paralyzed with fear. We feel trapped by our troubles, in pain like a woman giving birth. Don&quot;t go on the roads because the enemy has swords, and there is danger everywhere. Cry loudly for the dead. Cry as if you lost an only son. Do this because the destroyer will come against us very quickly. like a worker who tests metals. You will test my people and watch how they live. and they are very stubborn. They say bad things about people. They are like bronze and iron that are covered with rust and tarnish. The worker wasted his time trying to make that silver pure. In the same way the evil was not removed from my people. They will be given that name because the Lord did not accept them.&apos; Do these things because disaster is coming from the north. and build a siege mound against it. &apos;Gather the people of Israel who were left on their land. and pay attention, you people in those countries. &apos;An army is coming from the north. It is coming to attack you, Jerusalem. &apos; and roll in the ashes. The bellows blew strongly, and the fire became hotter, but only lead came from the fire."

Then my people will own that land again.&apos; &apos;We hear people crying from fear. There is fear, not peace. Can a man have a baby? Of course not! Then why do I see every strong man holding his stomach like a woman having labor pains? Why is everyone&quot;s face turning white like a dead man? This is a time of great trouble. There will never be another time like this, but Jacob will be saved. This message is from the Lord. &apos;Israel, don&quot;t be afraid. I will save you from that faraway place. but I will save your descendants. I will bring them back from that land. Jacob will have peace again. People will not bother Jacob. There will be no enemy to frighten my people. This message is from the Lord. &apos;I will save you. I sent you to those nations, but I will completely destroy all of them. It is true; I will destroy those nations, but I will not destroy you. You must be punished for the bad things you did, but I will discipline you fairly.&apos; &apos;You people of Israel and Judah have a wound that cannot be cured. You have an injury that will not heal. so you will not be healed. but those nations don&quot;t care about you. Your &quot;friends&quot; have forgotten you. I hurt you like an enemy. I punished you very hard. I did this because of your great guilt. I did this because of your many sins. There is no cure for it. I did this to you because of your great guilt. I did this because of your many sins. but now they have been destroyed. Israel and Judah, your enemies will become captives. They stole things from you, but others will steal from them. They took things from you in war, but others will take things from them in war. and heal your wounds,&apos; says the Lord, They said, &quot;No one cares about Zion.&quot;&apos; &apos;Jacob&quot;s people are now in captivity, but they will come back. And I will have pity on Jacob&quot;s houses. but the city will be rebuilt on its hill. And the king&quot;s palace will be rebuilt where it should be. and there will be the sound of laughter. I will give them many children. Israel and Judah will not be small. I will bring honor to them. No one will look down on them. I will make Israel and Judah strong, and I will punish those who hurt them.&apos; &apos;One of their own people will lead them. That ruler will come from my people. People can come close to me only if I ask them to. So I will ask that leader to come to me, and he will be close to me. and I will be your God.&apos; He punished the people. The punishment came like a storm. It came like a tornado against those wicked people. He will be angry until he finishes the punishment he planned. When that day comes, you people of Judah will understand."

So punish them until they act like a drunk, falling and rolling around in his vomit. Then people will make fun of them. Israel was caught by a gang of thieves. Every time you spoke about Israel, you shook your head and acted as if you were better than Israel. Go live among the rocks; be like a dove that makes its nest at the opening of a cave.&apos; He was very proud. He thought he was important. He was always bragging.

I stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses. There is no singing and dancing from people walking on the grapes to make wine. There are no shouts of joy. It is spreading its wings over Moab. The strong hiding places will be defeated. At that time Moab&quot;s soldiers will be filled with fear, like a woman giving birth. because they thought that they were more important than the Lord.&apos; and they will fall into the deep holes. Anyone who climbs out of the deep holes will be caught in the traps. I will bring the year of punishment to Moab.&apos; This is what the Lord said. They ran to safety in the town of Heshbon. But a fire started in Heshbon. and it is destroying the leaders of Moab. It is destroying those proud people. Chemosh&quot;s people are being destroyed. Your sons and daughters are being taken away as prisoners and captives. But in days to come, I will bring them back.&apos; This message is from the Lord. This ends the judgment on Moab."

The people have not left that &quot;fun city&quot; yet. All her soldiers will be killed at that time.&apos; This is what the Lord All-Powerful said. &apos;Go and attack the tribe of Kedar. Destroy the people of the East. Their tents and all their riches will be carried off. Their enemy will take away the camels. Men will shout this to them: &quot;Terrible things are happening all around us.&quot; People in Hazor, find a good place to hide.&apos; This message is from the Lord. &apos;Nebuchadnezzar has made plans against you. He thought of a smart plan to defeat you. that it does not have gates or fences to protect it. And no one lives near enough to help them. So attack that nation!&apos; says the Lord. Their large herds of cattle will be yours. I will bring disaster on them from every direction.&apos; This message is from the Lord. No one will live there. No one will stay in that place.&apos; &apos;I will break Elam&quot;s bow very soon. It is Elam&quot;s strongest weapon. I will bring them from the four corners of the skies. I will send the people of Elam to every place on the earth where the four winds blow. Elam&quot;s captives will be carried away to every nation. I will break Elam in front of the people who want to kill them. I will bring terrible troubles to them. I will show them how angry I am.&apos; This message is from the Lord. &apos;I will send a sword to chase Elam. The sword will chase them until I have killed them all. and I will destroy its king and his officials.&apos; This message is from the Lord. This message is from the Lord. Maybe that is why Milcom took Gad&quot;s land?&apos; The fire will completely burn up the strong forts of Ben-Hadad. &apos; I will scatter them throughout the earth&ndash;those people who cut their hair short."

They will start to go in that direction. They will say, &quot;Come, let us join ourselves to the Lord. Let&quot;s make an agreement that will last forever. Let&quot;s make an agreement that we will never forget.&quot; Their shepherds led them the wrong way and caused them to wander away into the mountains and hills.

They should have stayed close to him, their true resting place. The Lord is the one their fathers trusted in.&quot; Leave the land of the Babylonians. Be like the goats that lead the flock. This group of nations will get ready for war against Babylon. Babylon will be captured by people from the north. Those nations will shoot many arrows at Babylon. Their arrows will be like soldiers who don&quot;t come back from war with their hands empty. The soldiers will take all they want.&apos; This is what the Lord said. You took my land. You dance around like a young cow that got into the grain. Your laughter is like the happy sounds that horses make. The woman who gave you birth will be embarrassed. Babylon will be the least important of all the nations. She will be an empty, dry desert. so no one will live there. Babylon will be completely empty. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be afraid. They will shake their heads when they see how badly it has been destroyed. All you soldiers with bows, shoot your arrows at Babylon. Don&quot;t save any of your arrows. Babylon has sinned against the Lord. Babylon has surrendered! Her walls and towers have been pulled down! The Lord is giving her people the punishment they deserve. You nations should give Babylon the punishment she deserves. Do to her what she has done to other nations. Don&quot;t let them gather the harvest. The soldiers of Babylon brought many prisoners to their city. Now the enemy soldiers have come, so the prisoners are going back home. They are running back to their own countries. Israel is like sheep that were chased away by lions. The first lion to attack was the king of Assyria. The last lion to crush Israel&quot;s bones was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. &quot;I will soon punish the king of Babylon and his country as I punished the king of Assyria. He will eat food that grows on Mount Carmel and in the land of Bashan. He will eat and be full. He will eat on the hills in the lands of Ephraim and Gilead.&quot;&apos; but there will be no guilt. People will try to find Judah&quot;s sins, but no sins will be found. That is because I am saving a few survivors from Israel and Judah. And I am forgiving them for all their sins.&apos; Attack the people living in Pekod! Attack them! Kill them and destroy them completely! Do everything I commanded you! It is the noise of much destruction. &quot;The Hammer of the Whole Earth.&quot; But now the &quot;Hammer&quot; is shattered. Babylon is the most ruined of the nations. and you were caught before you knew it. You fought against the Lord, so you were found and captured. and brought out the weapons of his anger. The Lord GOD All-Powerful brought out those weapons, because he has work to do in the land of the Chaldeans. Break open the storehouses where she keeps her grain. Destroy Babylon completely. Don&quot;t leave anyone alive. Pile up her dead bodies like big piles of grain. Let them be slaughtered like bulls. How terrible for them that their day of defeat has come! It is time for them to be punished. They are escaping from that country and coming to Zion. They are telling everyone the good news about what the Lord is doing. The Lord our God is giving Babylon the punishment it deserves. The Lord is destroying Babylon, because it destroyed his Temple! Tell them to attack Babylon. Tell them to surround the city. Don&quot;t let anyone escape. Pay her back for the bad things she has done. Do to her what she has done to other nations. Babylon did not respect the Lord. Babylon was very rude to the Holy One of Israel. So punish Babylon. All her soldiers will die on that day.&apos; This is what the Lord says. and I am against you,&apos; says the Lord GOD All-Powerful. &apos;I am against you, and the time has come for you to be punished. and no one will help her get up. I will start a fire in her towns. That fire will completely burn up everyone around her.&apos; &apos;The people of Israel and Judah are slaves. The enemy took them, and the enemy will not let Israel go. His name is the Lord God All-Powerful. He will defend them very strongly. He will argue their case so that he can let their land rest. But there will be no rest for those living in Babylon.&apos; &apos;Sword, kill the people living in Babylon. Sword, kill the king&quot;s officials and the wise men of Babylon. They will be like fools. Sword, kill the soldiers of Babylon. They will be full of fear. Sword, kill all the soldiers hired from other countries. They will be like frightened women. Sword, destroy the treasures of Babylon. Those treasures will be taken away. Those waters will be dried up. Babylon has many, many idols. These idols show that the people of Babylon are foolish. So bad things will happen to them. Wild dogs, ostriches, and other desert animals will live there. But no one will live there ever again. and the towns around them. In the same way no one will live in Babylon, and no one will ever go to live there.&apos; This is what the Lord says. They come from a powerful nation. Many kings are coming together from all around the world. The soldiers are cruel. They have no mercy. The soldiers come riding on their horses; the sound is as loud as the roaring sea. They stand in their places, ready for battle. They are ready to attack you, city of Babylon. and he is paralyzed with fear. He is overcome with fear and pain, like a woman giving birth. from the thick bushes near the Jordan River. It will walk into the fields where people have their animals. I will be like that lion; I will chase Babylon from its land. Who should I choose to do this? There is no one like me. There is no one who can challenge me. No shepherd will come to chase me away. I will chase away the Babylonians.&apos; to do to Babylon. Listen to what he has decided to do to the Babylonians. &apos;I promise that an enemy will drag away the young kids of Babylon&quot;s flock, and Babylon will become an empty pasture. and that fall will shake the earth.

They will be badly wounded in the streets of Babylon.&apos; No, they are guilty of leaving the Holy One of Israel. Their God did not leave them. They left him! Run to save your lives! Don&quot;t stay and be killed because of Babylon&quot;s sins! It is time for the Lord to punish the Babylonians for the bad things they have done. Babylon will get the punishment that she should have. Babylon made the whole world drunk. The nations drank Babylon&quot;s wine, so they went crazy. Cry for her! Get medicine for her pain, and maybe she can be healed. but she cannot be healed. So let us leave her, and let each of us go to our own country. God in heaven will decide Babylon&quot;s punishment. He will decide what will happen to Babylon. Come, let&quot;s tell about that in Zion. Let&quot;s tell what the Lord our God has done. Get your shields! The Lord has stirred up the kings of the Medes because he wants to destroy Babylon. The army from Babylon destroyed his Temple in Jerusalem, so he will give them the punishment they deserve. Bring more guards. Put the watchmen in their places. Get ready for a secret attack. The Lord will do what he has planned. He will do what he said he would do against the people of Babylon. You are rich with treasures, but your end as a nation has come. It is time for you to be destroyed. &apos;Babylon, I will fill you with so many enemy soldiers they will be like a cloud of locusts. They will win their war against you. They will stand over you shouting their victory cry.&apos; He used his wisdom to build the world and his understanding to stretch out the skies. He sends clouds all over the earth. He sends lightning with the rain. He brings out the wind from his storehouses. They don&quot;t understand what God has done. Skilled workers make statues of false gods. Those statues are only false gods. They show how foolish those workers are. Those statues are not alive. People made them, and they are nothing but a joke. Their time of judgment will come, and those idols will be destroyed. People didn&quot;t make God; God made his people. He made everything. His name is the Lord All-Powerful. I used you to smash nations. I used you to destroy kingdoms. I used you to smash chariot and driver. I used you to smash men, old and young. I used you to smash young men and young women. I used you to smash farmers and oxen. I used you to smash governors and important officials. I will pay them back so that you can see it, Judah.&apos; This is what the Lord said. &apos;Babylon, you are like a volcano that destroys the whole country. But I have turned against you, and I will turn you into a burned-out mountain. That is because they will not find any stones big enough for cornerstones. Your city will be a pile of broken rocks forever.&apos; This is what the Lord said. Blow the trumpet in all the nations! Prepare the nations for war against Babylon. Call these kingdoms to come fight against Babylon: Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Choose a commander to lead the army against her. Send so many horses that they are like a swarm of locusts. Get the kings of the Medes ready. Get their governors and all their important officials ready. Get all the countries they rule ready for battle against Babylon. It will shake when the Lord does to Babylon what he plans&ndash; to make the land of Babylon an empty desert, a place where no one will live. They stay in their forts. Their strength is gone. They have become like frightened women. Babylon&quot;s houses are burning. The bars of her gates are broken. Messenger follows messenger. They announce to the king of Babylon that his whole city has been captured. The swamplands are burning. All of Babylon&quot;s soldiers are afraid.&apos; &apos;Babylon is like a threshing floor, where people beat the grain at harvest time. And the time to beat Babylon is coming soon. In the past he hurt us. In the past he took our people away, and we became like an empty jar. He took the best we had. He was like a giant monster that ate everything until it was full. He took the best we had and then threw us away. Now I want those things to happen to Babylon.&apos; The people living in Zion said, &apos;The people of Babylon are guilty of killing our people. Now they are being punished for the bad things they did.&apos; The city of Jerusalem said those things. &apos;I will defend you, Judah. I will make sure that Babylon is punished. I will dry up Babylon&quot;s sea. And I will make her water springs become dry. a place fit only for wild dogs. People will be shocked and shake their heads at what is left there. It will be a place where no one lives. They growl like baby lions. I will give a party for them. I will make them drunk. They will laugh and have a good time, and then they will sleep forever. They will never wake up.&apos; This is what the Lord said. I will lead them to the slaughter. The best and proudest country of the whole earth will be taken captive. People from other nations will look at Babylon, and what they see will make them afraid. Its roaring waves will cover her. Its cities will be empty ruins. No one will live in those cities. No one will even travel through them. I will make him vomit out the people he swallowed. The wall around Babylon will fall, and other nations will stop coming to Babylon. Run to save your lives. Run from the Lord&quot;s great anger. Rumors will spread, but don&quot;t be afraid. One rumor comes this year. Another rumor will come next year. There will be rumors about terrible fighting in the country. There will be rumors about rulers fighting against other rulers. and the whole land of Babylon will be put to shame. There will be many dead people, lying in the streets of that city. will shout with joy about Babylon. They will shout because an army came from the north and fought against Babylon.&apos; This is what the Lord said. Babylon killed people from every place on earth. So Babylon must fall! You must hurry and leave Babylon. Don&quot;t wait! You are in a faraway land, but remember the Lord where you are and remember Jerusalem.&apos; We have been insulted, because strangers have gone into the holy places of the Lord&quot;s Temple.&apos; when I will punish the idols of Babylon. At that time wounded people will cry with pain everywhere in that country. Babylon might make her forts strong, but I will send people to fight against that city. And they will destroy her.&apos; This is what the Lord said. We hear the sound of people destroying things in the land of Babylon. He will stop the loud noises in that city. Enemies will come roaring in like ocean waves. People all around will hear that roar. Its soldiers will be captured, and their bows will be broken, This will happen because the Lord punishes people for the bad things they do. He gives them the full punishment they deserve. and important officials drunk. I will make the governors, officers, and soldiers drunk too. Then they will sleep forever. They will never wake up.&apos; This is what the King said. His name is the Lord All-Powerful. &apos;Babylon&quot;s thick, strong wall will be pulled down. Her high gates will be burned. The people of Babylon will work hard, but it will not help. They will get very tired trying to save the city. But they will only be fuel for the flames.&apos; The words of Jeremiah end here. wind to blow against Babylon and the Babylonians."
