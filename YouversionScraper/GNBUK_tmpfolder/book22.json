I sought his presence, his fragrance, but could not find him anywhere. I called out for him, yet he did not answer me. I will arise and search for him until I find him. the overseers stopped me as they made their rounds. They beat me and bruised me until I could take no more. They wounded me deeply and removed my covering from me. if you find my beloved one, please tell him I endured all travails for him. and I will not be turned aside! How could you continue to care so deeply for him? Isn&quot;t there another who could steal away your heart? We see now your beauty, more beautiful than all the others. What makes your beloved better than any other? What is it about him that makes you ask us to promise you this? He shines in dazzling splendor yet is still so approachable&ndash; without equal as he stands above all others, His leadership&ndash;so pure and dignified as he wears his crown of gold. Upon this crown are letters of black written How beautiful his insights&ndash;without distortion. His eyes rest upon the fullness of the river of revelation, flowing so clean and pure. what a man! words that both pierce and heal, words like lilies dripping with myrrh. But he never uses it in anger, for he is always holy, displaying his glory. His innermost place is a work of art&ndash; so beautiful and bright. How magnificent and noble is this one&ndash; covered in majesty! His ways are the ways of righteousness, based on truth and holiness. None can rival him, He is delightful in every way and perfect from every viewpoint. If you ask me why I love him so, O brides-to-be, it&quot;s because there is none like him to me.

The Lord embraces their paths as they move forward while the way of the wicked leads only to doom."
