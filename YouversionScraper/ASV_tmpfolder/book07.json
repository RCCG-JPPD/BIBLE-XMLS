In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, And the travellers walked through byways. Until that I Deborah arose, That I arose a mother in Israel. Then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel? That offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye Jehovah. Ye that sit on rich carpets, And ye that walk by the way. There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, Even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates. Awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam. Jehovah came down for me against the mighty. After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal&quot;s staff. As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben There were great resolves of heart. To hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart. And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, And abode by his creeks. And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field. Then fought the kings of Canaan, In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money. From their courses they fought against Sisera. That ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength. By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones. Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, Because they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah against the mighty. The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed shall she be above women in the tent. She brought him butter in a lordly dish. And her right hand to the workmen&quot;s hammer; And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head; Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples. At her feet he bowed, he fell: Where he bowed, there he fell down dead. The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariots? Yea, she returned answer to herself, A damsel, two damsels to every man; To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil? But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years."
