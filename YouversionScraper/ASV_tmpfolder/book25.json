She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary! Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies. She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits. All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness. For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary. Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer. When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations. All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself. For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly. They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject. Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day. They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand. He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah. Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed. Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls. My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death. All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me. And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint."

He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof. He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire. He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly. He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together. Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah. They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, When their soul is poured out into their mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bosom. What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee? And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment. They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying , Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it. He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease. Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street. Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, and not pitied. And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of Jehovah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anger: Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed."
