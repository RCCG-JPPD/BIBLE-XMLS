So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong. And grope at noonday as in the night. Even the needy from the hand of the mighty. And iniquity stoppeth her mouth. Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. He woundeth, and his hands make whole. Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. And in war from the power of the sword. Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing. And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season. Hear it, and know thou it for thy good."

I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer; I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. Why then do I labor in vain?

Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know? And broader than the sea. And call unto judgment, then who can hinder him? He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not. Yea, man is born as a wild ass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colt. And stretch out thy hands toward him; And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents. Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away, Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. Yea, thou shalt search about thee , and shalt take thy rest in safety. Yea, many shall make suit unto thee. And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost."

And lay your hand upon your mouth. And horror taketh hold on my flesh. Become old, yea, wax mighty in power? And their offspring before their eyes. Neither is the rod of God upon them. Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. And their children dance. And rejoice at the sound of the pipe. And in a moment they go down to Sheol. For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? The counsel of the wicked is far from me. That their calamity cometh upon them? That God distributeth sorrows in his anger? And as chaff that the storm carrieth away? Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it: And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. When the number of his months is cut off? Seeing he judgeth those that are high? Being wholly at ease and quiet: And the marrow of his bones is moistened. And never tasteth of good. And the worm covereth them. And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me. And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt? And do ye not know their evidences, That they are led forth to the day of wrath? And who shall repay him what he hath done? And men shall keep watch over the tomb. And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him. Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?"

And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly. They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof. He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief. Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face. They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light. For they know the terrors of the thick darkness. Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards. So doth Sheol those that have sinned. The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree. And doeth not good to the widow. He riseth up that hath no assurance of life. And his eyes are upon their ways. Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain. And make my speech nothing worth?"

And when the eye saw me , it gave witness unto me: The fatherless also, that had none to help him. And I caused the widow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart to sing for joy. My justice was as a robe and a diadem. And feet was I to the lame. And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out. And plucked the prey out of his teeth. And I shall multiply my days as the sand: And the dew lieth all night upon my branch: And my bow is renewed in my hand. And kept silence for my counsel. And my speech distilled upon them. And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. And the light of my countenance they cast not down. And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners."

And God hath taken away my right: My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression. Who drinketh up scoffing like water, And walketh with wicked men? That he should delight himself with God. Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. And cause every man to find according to his ways. Neither will the Almighty pervert justice. Or who hath disposed the whole world? If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; And man shall turn again unto dust. Hearken to the voice of my words. And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Or to nobles, Ye are wicked; Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands. The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand. And he seeth all his goings. Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. That he should go before God in judgment. And setteth others in their stead. And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. In the open sight of others; And would not have regard in any of his ways: And he heard the cry of the afflicted. And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man: That there be none to ensnare the people. I have borne chastisement , I will not offend any more : If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest. Yea, every wise man that heareth me: And his words are without wisdom. Because of his answering like wicked men. He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God."

Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain. That all men whom he hath made may know it . And remain in their dens. And cold out of the north. And the breadth of the waters is straitened. He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning: That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine? The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? When the earth is still by reason of the south wind ? Which is strong as a molten mirror? For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness. Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? But the wind passeth, and cleareth them. God hath upon him terrible majesty. He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
