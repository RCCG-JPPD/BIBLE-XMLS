The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee. Oh ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon. Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother’s sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept. Where thou feedest thy flock , Where thou makest it to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions? Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. Thy neck with strings of jewels. With studs of silver. My spikenard sent forth its fragrance. That lieth betwixt my breasts. In the vineyards of En-gedi. Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves. Also our couch is green. And our rafters are firs."

Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He looketh in at the windows; He glanceth through the lattice. Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. The rain is over and gone; The time of the singing of birds is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land; And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. In the covert of the steep place, Let me see thy countenance, Let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom. He feedeth his flock among the lilies. Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether."

Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead. Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them. Behind thy veil. And virgins without number. She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; Yea , the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners? To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, And the pomegranates were in flower. Among the chariots of my princely people. Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?"

Leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple-tree I awakened thee: There thy mother was in travail with thee, There was she in travail that brought thee forth. As a seal upon thine arm: For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol; The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, A very flame of Jehovah. Neither can floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, He would utterly be contemned. And she hath no breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she shall be spoken for? We will build upon her a turret of silver: And if she be a door, We will inclose her with boards of cedar. Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace. He let out the vineyard unto keepers; Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand, And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. The companions hearken for thy voice: Cause me to hear it. And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart Upon the mountains of spices."
