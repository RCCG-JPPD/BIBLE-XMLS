And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears. The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth. And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it. And thick darkness was under his feet. Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind. Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. Hailstones and coals of fire. And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire. Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them. And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. He drew me out of many waters. And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me. But Jehovah was my stay. He delivered me, because he delighted in me. According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. And have not wickedly departed from my God. And I put not away his statutes from me. And I kept myself from mine iniquity. According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward. But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down. Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness. And by my God do I leap over a wall. The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him. And who is a rock, besides our God, And maketh my way perfect? And setteth me upon my high places. So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great. And my feet have not slipped. Neither will I turn again till they are consumed. They shall fall under my feet. Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. That I might cut off them that hate me. Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not. I did cast them out as the mire of the streets. Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me. The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me. And shall come trembling out of their close places. And exalted be the God of my salvation, And subdueth peoples under me. Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man. And will sing praises unto thy name. And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore."

And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil. It is as the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold. It was as when it snoweth in Zalmon. A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan. At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever. The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary. Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, among the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell with them . Even the God who is our salvation. [Selah And unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death. The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his guiltiness. I will bring them again from the depths of the sea; That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies. Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary. In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels. Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of Israel. The princes of Judah and their council, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. Kings shall bring presents unto thee. The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver: He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war. Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God. Oh sing praises unto the Lord; [Selah Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice. His excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies. The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God."

And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children; Who should arise and tell them to their children, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God. Turned back in the day of battle. And refused to walk in his law; And his wondrous works that he had showed them. In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. And he made the waters to stand as a heap. And all the night with a light of fire. And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. And caused waters to run down like rivers. To rebel against the Most High in the desert. By asking food according to their desire. They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people? And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel; And trusted not in his salvation. And opened the doors of heaven; And gave them food from heaven. He sent them food to the full. And by his power he guided the south wind. And winged birds as the sand of the seas: Round about their habitations. And he gave them their own desire. Their food was yet in their mouths, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel. And believed not in his wondrous works. And their years in terror. And they returned and sought God earnestly. And the Most High God their redeemer. And lied unto him with their tongue. Neither were they faithful in his covenant. Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath. A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. And grieve him in the desert! And provoked the Holy One of Israel. Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; And his wonders in the field of Zoan, And their streams, so that they could not drink. And frogs, which destroyed them. And their labor unto the locust. And their sycomore-trees with frost. And their flocks to hot thunderbolts. Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil. He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten. And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. And kept not his testimonies; They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. And greatly abhorred Israel; The tent which he placed among men; And his glory into the adversary&quot;s hand. And was wroth with his inheritance. And their virgins had no marriage-song. And their widows made no lamentation. Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. He put them to a perpetual reproach. And chose not the tribe of Ephraim, The mount Zion which he loved. Like the earth which he hath established for ever. And took him from the sheepfolds: To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands."

The waters stood above the mountains. At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. That they turn not again to cover the earth. They run among the mountains; The wild asses quench their thirst. They sing among the branches. The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man&quot;s heart. The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. The rocks are a refuge for the conies. The sun knoweth his going down. Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. And seek their food from God. And lay them down in their dens. And to his labor until the evening. In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches. Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts. There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein. That thou mayest give them their food in due season. Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust. And thou renewest the face of the ground. Let Jehovah rejoice in his works: He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. I will rejoice in Jehovah. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah."

From one kingdom to another people. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, And do my prophets no harm. He brake the whole staff of bread. Joseph was sold for a servant: He was laid in chains of iron, The word of Jehovah tried him. Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. And ruler of all his substance; And teach his elders wisdom. And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. And made them stronger than their adversaries. To deal subtly with his servants. And Aaron whom he had chosen. And wonders in the land of Ham. And they rebelled not against his words. And slew their fish. In the chambers of their kings. And lice in all their borders. And flaming fire in their land. And brake the trees of their borders. And the grasshopper, and that without number, And did eat up the fruit of their ground. The chief of all their strength. And there was not one feeble person among his tribes. For the fear of them had fallen upon them. And fire to give light in the night. And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. They ran in the dry places like a river. And Abraham his servant. And his chosen with singing. And they took the labor of the peoples in possession: And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah."

That he might make his mighty power to be known. So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. There was not one of them left. They sang his praise. They waited not for his counsel, And tempted God in the desert. But sent leanness into their soul. And Aaron the saint of Jehovah. And covered the company of Abiram. The flame burned up the wicked. And worshipped a molten image. For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. Who had done great things in Egypt, And terrible things by the Red Sea. Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them . They believed not his word, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. That he would overthrow them in the wilderness, And scatter them in the lands. And ate the sacrifices of the dead. And the plague brake in upon them. And so the plague was stayed. Unto all generations for evermore. So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. As Jehovah commanded them, And learned their works, Which became a snare unto them. Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood. And played the harlot in their doings. And he abhorred his inheritance. And they that hated them ruled over them. And they were brought into subjection under their hand. But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity. When he heard their cry: And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses. Of all those that carried them captive. And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise. From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah."
