We&quot;ll swallow them up alive and take what we want from whomever we want. Take your chance with us. We&quot;ll divide up all we get; we&quot;ll each end up with big bags of cash!&apos;&ndash; but eventually it will be their own lives that are ambushed. they bring destruction on their own lives. and celebrated far and wide. But in the hustle and bustle of everyday life You will hear wisdom&quot;s warning as she preaches courageously to those who stop to listen: How much longer will you mock wisdom, you cynical scorners who fight the facts? Don&quot;t even think about refusing my rebuke! Don&quot;t you know that I&quot;m ready to pour out my spirit of wisdom upon you and bring to you the revelation of my words that will make your heart wise? still you refuse to come to me. I&quot;ve pleaded with you again and again, yet you&quot;ve turned a deaf ear to my voice. and have insisted on continuing in your stubbornness, and will turn away from you at the time of your disaster. Make a joke of my advice, will you? Then I&quot;ll make a joke out of you! when dread and distress consume you and your catastrophe comes like a hurricane, Then it will be too late to expect my help. When desperation drives you to search for me, I will be nowhere to be found. and closed your eyes to the facts and laughed at my correction&ndash; You&quot;ve made your own bed; now lie in it! So how do you like that? and chosen destruction instead. will live undisturbed in a heavenly peace. Free from fear, confident and courageous, that one will rest unafraid and sheltered from the storms of life.&apos;"

He will grudgingly say, &apos;Go ahead and eat all you want,&apos; but in his heart he resents the fact that he has to pay for your meal. and all your compliments will be wasted. so don&quot;t even waste your time&ndash;save your breath! or attempt to take land that belongs to the fatherless. and he will stand up for their cause. and open your heart to every word of instruction. Don&quot;t worry&ndash;it won&quot;t kill him! my heart is full of gladness. Instead, burn with unrelenting passion as you worship God in holy awe. that will never fade away. you will grow in wisdom and your heart will be drawn into understanding, and end up broke! for without them you wouldn&quot;t even be here. And don&quot;t neglect them when they grow old. Don&quot;t let go of wisdom, instruction, and life-giving understanding. he is ecstatic with joy&ndash;nothing makes him prouder! and your mother&quot;s soul be filled with gladness because of you. and embrace fully what I&quot;m about to tell you. and you&quot;ll stay far away from the pit of destruction. For sleeping with a promiscuous woman is like falling into a trap that you&quot;ll never be able to escape! she&quot;s waiting to claim another victim&ndash; another husband unfaithful to his wife. Who constantly complains and argues? Who stumbles and falls and hurts himself? Who&quot;s the one with bloodshot eyes? and is always looking for a brew. Make sure it&quot;s never you! but be known as one who enjoys the company and speak words that are perverse. dizzy and out of your mind. I feel like I&quot;ve been run over by a truck!&apos; Yet off you&quot;ll go, looking for another drink!"

She is like a trading ship bringing divine supplies from the merchant. for hungry ones in her house and for others. She labors there to plant the living vines. no matter how dark the night. and she lays hold of the wheels of government. for she always reaches out her hands to those in need. for all her household is covered in the dual garments sitting as the venerable judge of his people. she does for the benefit of her enemies. as she laughs with joy over the latter days. as loving instruction pours from her lips. and her husband arises to speak of her in glowing terms. but you have ascended above them all!&apos; at the gateways of every city!"

Wine is for those in depression in order to drown their sorrows. Let them drink and forget their poverty and misery. of the disenfranchised and pleads for the legal rights of the defenseless and those who are dying. She&quot;s full of wealth and wisdom. for she brings him the rich spoils of victory. and her shining light will not be extinguished, of righteousness and grace. a purple gown of exquisite linen. and meets every need they have. and beauty is vain and so quickly fades, but this virtuous woman lives in the wonder, awe, and fear of the Lord. She will be praised throughout eternity . for she has become a radiant woman, and all her loving works of righteousness deserve to be admired"
