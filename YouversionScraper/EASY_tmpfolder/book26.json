When he roared , the noise frightened everyone in the land. They threw a net over him. They caught him in their trap. They took him to the king of Babylon. There they put him in prison to stop him roaring. The people on the hills of Israel could not hear his voice any longer. It grew well because there was plenty of water there. It made many branches and it had a lot of fruit. They were strong enough to make a ruler's stick of authority. The vine grew taller than all the other trees around it. Everyone could see that it was very tall and strong. He pulled up its roots and he threw it down to the ground. The east wind made it dry and destroyed its fruit. Its strong branches broke and they became useless . Fire destroyed them. It is in a hot, dry place where there is no water. From there the fire destroyed its other branches and its fruit. No strong branch remained in the vine. Now there was nothing to make a ruler's stick of authority.&apos; This is a funeral song. It tells a very sad story.&quot;"

You have stored much gold and silver in your palace . you have become even richer. And because of your riches , you have become very proud. You think that you are as wise as a god. They will be a very cruel enemy. They will use their swords to destroy your beautiful city. They will spoil the beautiful things that you have used your wisdom to get for yourselves. and the sea will become your grave . you will no longer say, &quot;I am a god.&quot; When they are ready to kill you, you will know that you are only human. You will die like people who do not belong to me. I, the Almighty Lord have said this.&apos; &quot; At one time, you were the example of a good man. You were completely wise and beautiful. You wore valuable jewels on your clothes. The jewels were ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, They were fixed to pieces of gold. They were ready for you to wear on the day that you were born. You lived on my holy mountain. You walked among the stones that burned with fire. from the day that you were born. But later, you started to do wicked things. As a result, you became violent and you did evil things. So I sent you away in shame . I would not allow you to remain on my mountain. The cherub that had been your guard chased you out. You could no longer walk among the stones that burned with fire. You used your wisdom to do bad things, because you loved to have beautiful things. So I threw you down to the ground. I let other kings see what had happened to you. Your holy places became unclean . So I caused fire to completely destroy your city. Everyone could see that only ashes remained on the ground. They have seen the terrible thing that has happened to you. You have come to a complete end and you will never return.&apos; &quot; Listen! I have become your enemy, Sidon. I will show your people how great I am. Then they will know that I am the Lord . I will punish your people for their sins so that they know that I am a holy God. Enemies will attack from all around the city, and people will die in the streets. Then they will know that I am the Lord ."
