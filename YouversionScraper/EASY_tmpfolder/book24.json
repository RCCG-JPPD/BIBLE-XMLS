I promised to punish anyone who tried to hurt them. I sent great trouble to those who attacked you. That is what I, the Lord , have said.&apos; &quot; &quot;I had done nothing wrong against your ancestors , but they turned away from me. Instead, they worshipped useless idols . So they themselves became useless. &apos;Where is the Lord ? We should ask him to help us. He brought us safely out of Egypt. He led us through the wilderness . It was a place with dry sand and deep holes. There was no water there and it was dangerous. Nobody lives in that desert, and nobody even travels through it.&apos; It was a place where fruit grew on trees. You could eat all those good things, as well as the crops that you grew there. You came into the land that I had promised to give to you. But you spoiled it with your sins . You made it a disgusting place. The people who taught my laws did not know me. Your leaders turned against me. Your prophets spoke messages from Baal . They worshipped useless idols .&quot; &quot;Because of your sins, I will speak against you in court . I will show that you are guilty , as well as your children and your grandchildren. Send people across the sea to islands in the west. Or send them to the deserts in the east. Let them find out if any other people have done this terrible thing. No! They have not done that, even to their false gods! But my people have turned against me, the true God who makes them great.&quot; &quot;The whole universe should see how terrible this is. Yes, everything should shake with fear ! I give them life, like a spring of fresh water, but they have turned away from me. Instead, they have tried to get water for themselves. They have dug holes in the ground to store it. But those holes cannot hold the water. It quickly runs away. They were not born as slaves. But their enemies have taken them away as prisoners . They have destroyed my people's land. They have destroyed your cities with fire. Nobody lives in them any more. The Lord your God was leading you on the right way. But you decided not to follow him any longer. If you drink water from the Nile river, will that make you strong? No! And what help will you get from Assyria? If you drink water from the Euphrates river, will that make you strong? No! You are guilty because you have turned away from me. You have brought terrible trouble on yourselves, because you have turned against me, the Lord your God. Because you no longer respect me, you will realize that you are in great trouble.&quot; That is what the Lord God Almighty says. You refused to accept my authority. You said, &apos;I will not serve you!&apos; Instead, you go up on the hills to worship other gods. You lie down under the green trees, and you live like prostitutes . like the very good seed of a vine . But see how you have changed! You have become like a wild vine. Your grapes are bad and useless. But I still see the dirt of your sins .&quot; That is what the Almighty Lord says. We do not worship the idols of Baal.&apos; You hurry to find another idol that you can worship. Like a female camel , you cannot control yourselves. She lifts her nose to smell the air. She wants to find a male donkey. Nobody can control her. Male donkeys do not have to chase her. She will come to them to have sex with them. You are like that as you chase after false gods. Your feet will hurt and you will become very thirsty . You say, &apos;Do not try to stop us! We cannot turn back. We love foreign gods and we must serve them!&apos; The people of Israel will become ashamed like that. They will all be ashamed of their sins . Their kings, their officers, their priests and their prophets are all guilty . and they say, &apos;You are my father.&apos; They say to a stone, &apos;You gave birth to me.&apos; They have not turned to come to me. Instead, they have turned away from me. But when trouble comes to them, they call out to me to rescue them. Ask them to save you when trouble comes! You have enough gods to give you help. Yes, people of Judah, your gods are as many as your towns! You have all turned against me.&quot; That is what the Lord says. they did not change how they lived. When I sent my prophets to you, you killed them as if you were a hungry lion .&quot; &quot;People of Israel, why do you not trust me? Have I become like a desert for you? Have I become a dark and dangerous land for you to live in? No! But you say, &apos;We are free to go where we like. We do not need to serve you any more.&apos; When a woman marries, she does not forget to wear her special dress. But for many years, my people have forgotten me. Even prostitutes could learn something from you! Your clothes have their blood on them! They had not robbed you, but you still killed them. You have done all these bad things, but still you say, God cannot be angry with us!&apos; Be careful! I will surely punish you, because you say, &apos;I am not guilty of any sin .&apos; You run here and there to make new friends. You hoped for help from Assyria, but no help came. And you will get no help from Egypt either. You will be ashamed and upset . The Lord has turned away from those nations. You have trusted them to help you, But you will not receive any help from them.&quot;"

They will bring their armies, like shepherds with their sheep. They will make their camps all around the city. Each of them will take their own piece of land. &quot;Get ready to attack the city! We will attack at noon!&quot; But if the day is almost finished, they will say, &quot;It is already evening and it will soon be dark. We will destroy all their strong buildings!&quot; &quot;Cut down the trees around Jerusalem. Use them to build towers to the top of the city's walls. I must punish Jerusalem. It is full of cruel people. like water that pours out from a spring . It is full of the noise of violence and fights. Everywhere I see people who have disease and wounds . If not, I will turn away from you. I will destroy you completely. Nobody will live on your land any more.&quot; &quot;I will let the enemy take all the people from Israel, like a farmer who picks all the grapes from his vine . So check the vines carefully, to see if there are some grapes that you can save.&quot; &quot;If I speak to people and I warn them, nobody will listen to me. They have shut their ears so that they cannot hear. They hate the Lord 's message. They do not want to hear it. I can no longer control my anger .&quot; The Lord replied, &quot;Tell everyone how angry you are! Tell the children who play in the streets, Tell the young men who meet together. Include all the men and their wives, as well as the old people, and those who are near to death. Other people will take their fields and their wives. Yes, I will punish the people who live in this land.&quot; That is what the Lord says. Important people and ordinary people do that. Prophets and priests do that. They love to deceive people. They say to them, &apos;No problem! You will have peace !&apos; But there will be no peace for my people. They do not even know what shame is. They have forgotten how to be ashamed. So they will fall to the ground, as other people have fallen. When I decide to punish them, that will be the end of them.&quot; That is what the Lord says. &quot;Stand at the place where the roads cross, and look carefully. Find the good way, and go along that way. Then you will live in peace .&quot; But the people said, &quot;No, we will not go that way. &quot; &quot;I sent my prophets to warn you of danger. They said, &apos;Listen for the noise of the trumpet ! That will tell you when danger is near.&apos; But you said, &apos;We do not want to listen.&apos; Look carefully! See what will happen to my people. I will cause great trouble for my people. I will punish them as a result of their wrong thoughts. They have not listened to my messages. They have turned against my law . But that does not please me. The spices that they bring from lands far away do not please me either. I will not accept the burnt offerings or other sacrifices that they offer to me.&quot; &quot;I will send troubles to make these people fall down. Fathers and their children will all fall to the ground. Their friends and their neighbours will die.&quot; &quot;Look! An army is coming from the north. A great nation is preparing to attack you from a place that is far away. They are always cruel and they are never kind. They ride into the battle on their horses, and it sounds like the noise of the sea. They are ready to attack you, people of Jerusalem.&quot; &quot;We have heard news about them, and we are very frightened. We feel too weak to fight. We are afraid and in pain, like a woman who is giving birth. Do not travel on the roads. Our enemies are everywhere. They have their swords ready to attack us. Danger is all around us.&quot; Wear sackcloth and sit in ashes . Weep and cry aloud, as if your only child had died. Realize that the enemy's army will soon be here and they are ready to destroy us.&quot; &quot;I have sent you to test my people. Test them like someone tests metal. Watch them carefully, to see how they live. They refuse to change their minds. They tell lies against people, and they cheat them. and make it pure . I punish my people to make them pure, but it is useless . There are too many wicked people, so I cannot make them pure. so they are like useless silver.&quot;"

I will cause other nations to give them honour . They will no longer insult my people. as they were long ago. They will serve me together as one group of people. I will punish anyone who wants to hurt them. I will ask him to come near to me, and he will come near. Nobody would be brave enough to come near to me, unless I asked him to come.&quot; That is what the Lord says. and I will be your God. &quot; like a strong storm. Like a strong wind, it will blow away the heads of wicked people. until he has finished what he has decided to do. When the time comes, you will understand this clearly."

He said, &quot;I have always loved you and I always will love you. My faithful love for you continues for ever. I will make you strong again. You will be so happy that you dance, as people make music with tambourines . on the hills in Samaria. Yes, farmers will plant vines and they will eat their fruit. as they watch for danger in the hills of Ephraim. They will shout, &apos;Let us go up to Zion , &quot;Sing with joy for Jacob's descendants! They are the greatest of all the nations ! Praise the Lord with loud voices! Say, &apos; Lord , please save your people. Save those Israelites who are still alive.&apos; I will bring them back from the land in the north. Wherever they are, I will bring them back. A great crowd of my people will return. Blind people will be among them, and people who cannot walk well. There will be pregnant women and some who will very soon give birth. They will pray for my help as I lead them. I will lead them beside streams of fresh water, and on flat paths where they will not fall down. I will help them because I am a father for Israel's people. listen to the Lord 's message. Shout it aloud for everyone to hear, even those who live on the coasts far away. Say, &quot;The Lord chased Israel's people away, but now he will bring them back. He will take care of them, like a shepherd who takes care of his sheep.&quot; He will pay the cost to let them be free. They will no longer be under the power of people who were stronger than them. and they will shout with joy . They will be very happy because of all the good things that the Lord gives to them. There will be grain to make bread, new wine and olive oil. There will be lambs and young cows. They will grow and be strong, like a garden that has plenty of water. They will not be weak or sad any more. &quot;Young women will dance because they are happy. The young men and the old men will also be happy. I will cause them to laugh instead of weep.

My people will have everything that they need, because of all the good things that I give to them.&quot; &quot;You can hear a sad noise in Ramah. Someone is weeping with a loud voice.

Your children will return from the land of their enemies.&quot; That is what the Lord says. Your children will return to their own land.&quot; That is what the Lord says. They say to me, &apos;You punished us, and we accepted it. You taught us to obey you, like a farmer teaches an ox to work for him. So let us come back to serve you. We are ready to return to you, because you are the Lord , our God. we were sorry that we had done that. We understood what we had done, and we showed that we were sad. We were ashamed and upset , because of the disgusting things that we did when we were young.&apos; I still love them, even when I have to speak against them. I can never forget them. I only want to help them. I will certainly be kind to them.&quot; That is what the Lord says. so that you know the way to go. Remember the road that you travelled on when you went away from your land. Now return, my special people, Israel. Return to your cities that you had to leave. like a daughter who refuses to obey her father. Do not continue to turn away from me. I, the Lord , promise to do a new thing. Women will take care of men!&quot; &quot;The time will come when I fill the lands of Israel and Judah with people and animals. He causes the moon and the stars to shine at night. He causes the waves of the sea to move around and they make a loud noise. He is the Lord Almighty, and he makes this promise: I will always cause the laws that rule everything to continue. I could never forget those laws, and I could never forget my people.&quot; &quot;Nobody can measure the size of the sky. Nobody can dig down to the bottom of the earth's foundations . In the same way, I can never turn away from all Israel's people. I will not leave them, even though they have done wicked things.&quot; &quot;The time will soon come when this city of Jerusalem belongs to me again. You will build it all again, from the tower of Hananel to the Corner gate."

In Heshbon, Moab's enemies will decide how to destroy the nation . They will say, &apos;We must completely destroy Moab!&apos; The town of Madmen will become silent, as a great army chases out the people. because a strong army is destroying them. Its children will cry loudly. They will weep as they go. As they go down the road towards Horonaim, they will cry about their town that the enemy is destroying. Go and live in the desert .&apos; Because of that, your enemies will catch you. They will even take your god Chemosh away as prisoner , together with his priests and officers. No town or city will escape . The enemy will destroy every place in the valley, and every place on the high ground. They will become heaps of stones. I, the Lord , tell you this! Its land will become like a desert . Its cities will become heaps of stones. Nobody will live in them.&quot; &apos;We are brave soldiers who know how to fight.&apos; The enemy will soon destroy Moab and its cities. They will kill its strongest young men. Terrible trouble will quickly destroy it. you know how famous it has been. But now you must weep for it. Say, &apos;Moab's royal power is finished! They no longer have great power to rule!&apos; Come down from the places where people give you honour. Sit on the ground in the dirt. Moab's cruel enemy has arrived. They will cause your strong buildings to become heaps of stones. stand beside the road and watch. Ask the people who are running away what has happened. and its people are ashamed.

Instead, the shouts will be shouts about trouble. The noise reaches as far as Jahaz. It reaches from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-Shelishiyah. Even the Nimrim river has become dry.&quot; &quot;I will remove the people of Moab who worship other gods. They offer sacrifices to them and they burn incense at their altars . I weep like a flute that plays a funeral song. I am sad for the people of Kir-Heres, because all their riches will disappear . They will cut the hair off their heads and their faces. They will use knives to cut their hands. They will wear sackcloth as their clothes. They are standing in the streets. They are all crying and weeping. They are sad because I have destroyed Moab. I have broken it in pieces, like a jar that I no longer want.&quot; That is what the Lord says. Its people will weep with loud voices. They will turn away because they are ashamed. All the nations around there will laugh at Moab. They will see the terrible trouble that it has received.&quot; &quot;Look at the enemy that suddenly arrives! It comes like an eagle that flies down to catch its food. Moab's soldiers will be afraid, like a woman who will soon give birth. So they will no longer be a nation.&quot; &quot;People of Moab, there will be danger, deep holes and traps that are ready to catch you! And a trap will catch anyone who climbs out of the deep hole. Yes, the time will soon come when I will punish Moab's people. They will be helpless as they stand outside its walls. Flames of fire will come out from Heshbon, the city where King Sihon once ruled. It will burn as far as Moab's borders. It will destroy those proud people who love to fight. The enemy will destroy you people who worship Chemosh. They will take away your sons and your daughters.

When the brave soldiers of Edom see that, they will become very afraid. They will be afraid, like a woman who will soon give birth.&quot; &quot;The people of Hamath and Arpad will hear bad news. It will cause them to be upset . They will no longer feel brave. They will not be able to rest because they are afraid. They will try to run away. They will become confused because of their fear. They will feel pain like a woman who is giving birth. The people who lived in it were very happy. But now it will become empty. All its soldiers will be dead. Fire will destroy the palaces of King Ben-Hadad.&quot; That is what the Lord Almighty says. Destroy those people who live east of Judah. Take their curtains and the other things in their tents. Carry those things away with their camels . Cause the people to shout, &quot;You people who live in Hazor, run away quickly! Go and find somewhere safe to hide! King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has decided to attack you. He knows how he will destroy you.&quot; &quot;Go and attack that nation . They think that they are strong and safe. But their city has no gates or walls to protect them. They live far away from other people. I will chase away those people who live in the desert and who cut their hair short. I will send them away in every direction. And I will bring terrible trouble from every direction to hurt them. Only wild animals will live there. It will always be a place where no people live.&quot; &quot;Listen to me! Elam's army makes them a strong nation . They have soldiers who can shoot arrows well. But I will destroy those soldiers. like winds that blow from every direction. I will chase Elam's people away in every direction. They will run away to live in every other nation of the world. I will cause them to have terrible trouble, because I am very angry with them.&quot; That is what the Lord says. &quot;I will send soldiers to attack them, until I have completely destroyed them. I will be the king who rules over Elam.&quot; That is what the Lord says. I will make Elam strong again.&quot; That is what the Lord says. They should not be living in towns that belong to Gad's people.&quot; &quot;I will bring terror all around you. &quot;March to Kedar and attack the city! &apos; Terror is everywhere around us!&apos; &quot;"

And they will no longer be guilty of any sins.&quot; That is what the Lord says. &quot;Attack the land of Merathaim. Run after them! Kill them! Completely destroy them! Do everything that I have commanded you to do. The enemy is destroying everything! like a hammer that breaks things into pieces. But now that hammer has broken into pieces. Now the other nations see that Babylon is a disgusting place. and you did not know about it. Now I have caught you in my trap, because you fought against me. I will use those weapons to punish the people of Babylonia, I am the Lord God Almighty. I have work to do in the land of Babylonia. Break open the store rooms and take out the grain . Knock down their buildings and break them into pieces. Completely destroy everything. Do not let anything remain! Let them go to their place of death!

Now the day has come when I will punish you for your sins. Nobody will help you to get up. I will burn Babylonia's towns with fire, and it will destroy everything that is around them.&quot; &quot;People have been cruel to the people of Israel and Judah. Enemies have taken them away as prisoners . They have refused to let my people go free. I am strong and I will rescue my people. I will fight hard to save them. I will bring peace to their land.

They will attack the people of Babylonia, its leaders and its wise men. and people will see that the prophets are fools. They will attack the soldiers of Babylonia, and those soldiers will be very afraid. and the foreign soldiers who belong to its army. They will become as weak as women. The enemy soldiers will take Babylon's valuable things. They will take them away for themselves. so that the rivers and streams become dry. I will send all this trouble because their whole land is full of idols . The people become crazy because they are afraid of their idols. Ostriches will live there, too. But people will never live there again. It will remain as empty as a desert . The same thing happened to Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near to them. Nobody will live there any more.&quot; That is what the Lord says. A great nation and many kings are preparing to attack. They are coming from a place that is far away. They are always cruel and they are never kind. They ride into the battle on their horses, and it sounds like the noise of the sea. They are ready to attack you, people of Babylon! and he is very afraid. He feels too weak to fight. He feels pain like a woman who is giving birth. and I will chase them out of their land. I will do that like a lion that has been hiding in the forest. It attacks the sheep in the fields beside the Jordan River. Like that lion, I will suddenly chase Babylonia's people out of their country. Then I will choose a leader to rule that nation. There is nobody who is like me. Nobody can accuse me of anything. No ruler can stand against me. This is what I have decided to do to Babylon. Yes, this is the trouble that I will bring to the people of Babylonia. Soldiers will catch their children and take them away, like little lambs that they take from their mothers. I will completely destroy their homes. the noise will cause the whole earth to shake .

Completely destroy their whole army. all over Babylonia and in the streets of the city. will not leave Israel and Judah on their own. Those people are guilty of many bad things Run quickly to escape from there! Do not stay there to die along with Babylonia's people. The time has come for the Lord to pay them back for their sins . He will punish them as they deserve . It made everyone become drunk, and so they all became crazy. An enemy will destroy it, so weep for it! Find some medicine that will make its wounds better. Perhaps it will become well again. &apos;We tried to make its wounds better, but it was not possible to do it. Now we must leave it. We must each go back to our own country. Its punishment will have no end. It will reach as high as the sky!&apos; &apos;The Lord has shown that we are his people. Now we must go to Jerusalem. We must tell people in Zion about how the Lord our God has helped us.&apos; &quot; Prepare your weapons ! The Lord has caused Media's kings to prepare for war. He will use them to destroy Babylon. The Lord will punish the people of Babylonia because they destroyed his temple . Bring plenty of guards to watch all around the city. Put soldiers to catch anyone who tries to escape . Yes, the Lord will now do everything that he has decided. He will punish Babylon's people, as he said he would do. it is now time for you to die. You have become rich with many valuable things, with the authority of his own name: &quot;I will cause the enemy's soldiers to fill your cities. They will come like a big crowd of locusts . They will shout loudly when they take your city for themselves.&quot; He used his wisdom to make it strong. He knew how to put the sky to cover the earth. the water in the sky roars . He brings the clouds from the far places of the earth. He causes bright lightning to show in the storms. He opens his rooms so that the wind comes out and it blows everywhere.

I have used you to destroy rulers and their officers. and all the people who live in Babylonia. I will pay them back for all the evil things that they did in Jerusalem. And you will see me do that.&quot; That is what the Lord says. &quot;Listen to me, Babylon! I am your enemy! You are like a strong mountain that destroys the whole earth. I will punish you with all my strength . I will push you down from your high place. I will make you a heap of ashes . as a foundation for a new building. You will remain as empty as a desert for ever.&quot; That is what the Lord says. Wave a flag and make a noise with trumpets , so that these kingdoms prepare their armies to attack: Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Choose a captain to lead them into battle. Send an army of soldiers on horses to attack, like a large crowd of locusts . Tell the kings of Media to get ready, as well as their leaders and officers. The armies of the countries that they rule must also be ready to fight. as the Lord punishes Babylonia. He will certainly do what he has decided to do. He will make the land of Babylonia as empty as a desert . Nobody will live there. They remain inside their strong buildings. Their strength has gone! They are as weak as women. In their cities, enemy soldiers are burning their houses. They have broken down the city gates. They pass this message along the line: &apos;The enemy has taken power over the whole city! They have burned the reeds in the wet fields. All our soldiers are afraid.&apos; Babylon is like a threshing floor that is ready for people to stamp on wheat . The harvest time will soon come! Then the enemy will cut down Babylon, and they will stamp all over it!&quot; He has made us weak and confused. He has eaten us like a hungry monster . He has filled himself with all our good things. Then he spat us out of his mouth.&quot; &quot;Please punish the people of Babylonia, because they did cruel things to us.&quot; Jerusalem's people say, &quot;Pay back the people of Babylonia, because they killed our relatives .&quot; &quot;I will help you to win.

I will cause them to become drunk, and they will become helpless . They will sleep for ever and they will never wake up again.&quot; That is what the Lord says. People will kill them as if they are lambs , sheep and goats.&quot; Everyone in the world praised it as a great nation. But now all the nations will see that it is a disgusting place. Many waves of water will cover it. The land will be dry and empty, like a desert . Nobody will live there any more. Nobody will even travel through the land. I will cause him to give back everything that he has taken. Nations will never go to worship him again. Yes, the walls of Babylon will fall down!&quot; Run away to save your lives! The Lord is very angry with that place, so run away from there! When you hear news in Babylon of what is happening, do not be afraid. People will report one thing this year, and next year they will report a different thing. They will speak about violence in the land, and about rulers who are fighting against each other. The whole country will become ashamed. Its people will die and their dead bodies will lie everywhere. will shout with joy because of what happens to Babylon. They will be happy because an army will come from the north to destroy it.&quot; That is what the Lord says. They have killed many Israelites. So now Babylon must lose its power. leave Babylon now! Do not wait! You are far away from your homes. But remember that the Lord is with you. Think about Jerusalem. We hide our faces in shame because foreigners have gone into the holy places of the Lord 's temple .&apos; &quot; &quot;The time will soon come when I will punish Babylon's idols. People everywhere in that land will cry with pain, because their wounds are causing them to die. They may make its walls very strong. But I will send an army to destroy it.&quot; That is what the Lord says. People are crying in pain. Listen to the noise of the enemy army as it destroys Babylonia. No noise will come from there any more. The enemy soldiers will attack like great waves of water. There will be a loud noise of battle . They will take hold of its brave soldiers. They will break their weapons . The Lord is a God who punishes people as they deserve . He always pays them back for their sins . as well as its rulers, its leaders and its soldiers. They will sleep for ever and they will never wake up again.&quot; That is what the King says. His name is the Lord Almighty. &quot;The enemy will completely knock down the strong walls of Babylon. They will burn its high gates with fire. The nations work very hard, but their work is useless . They make themselves tired, but fire destroys all their work.&quot; That is the end of Jeremiah's messages."
