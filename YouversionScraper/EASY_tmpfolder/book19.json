Knock them down! Take your sword and save me from those wicked men. They only think about this world, and they enjoy the good things that it gives them. So give them all that you have ready for them.

I called to my God to help me. He heard my voice from his home in heaven . My prayer reached his ears. Even the strong mountains shook, because God was angry. Fire and hot coals came out from his mouth, to destroy his enemies. Dark clouds were under his feet. The wind carried him as he travelled. He hid himself in dark clouds that held rain. Hail and lightning fell from the clouds. People everywhere heard the voice of the Most High God. He caused his enemies to run away. even the bottom of the deep sea appeared. People could see the foundations of the earth, when you breathed out in anger . He took hold of me and he pulled me up out of the deep water. The people who hated me were too strong for me, but the Lord saved me from their power. but the Lord helped me. He saved me because I made him happy. because I do things that please him. He blesses me because I am not guilty of bad things. I have not turned against my God. and I do not refuse to obey them. I kept away from any sin . because I did good things. He sees that I am not guilty. then you are faithful to them. If people do nothing that is bad, they can trust you to do nothing bad to them. they can trust you to be kind to them. But if people are wicked , you turn against them. But if people are proud , you bring them down very low. My God is my light in the dark. so that I can attack a whole army! With the help of my God, Yes, the Lord 's promises are always true. He keeps safe everyone who goes to him for help, like a shield that keeps a soldier safe. and no one else. Only our God can keep us safe, like a strong rock! He shows me the safe way through my life. Like a deer , I can stand on high mountains and not fall. He makes my arms strong You have kept me safe, like a shield . Your kind help has made me great. so that my feet do not slip . I did not turn back until I had killed them. They could not get up again. They fell under my feet. so that I win against my enemies. and they run away from me. I can destroy those who hate me. but nobody is there to help them. They call to the Lord , but he does not answer them. that the wind blows away. I walk over them, like dirt that lies on the streets. You made me a ruler of other nations . People that I did not know before now serve me as their ruler. they choose to obey me. They cannot stand against me because they are afraid. They shake with fear , as they come out of their strong cities. Everyone should praise him! He rules as king! He is the God who saves me. He makes the nations obey me. Yes, God, you give me power to win against those who attack me. You keep me safe from angry and cruel men. so that all the nations know about you. I will sing to praise your name. He gives me great strength to win against my enemies. He will continue to be kind to me and to my descendants for ever."

They run away when they see me in the street. I might as well be dead! They think that I am useless , like a broken plate. News from everywhere makes me afraid. They are deciding together how to kill me. what will happen to me in my whole life. Save me from the power of my enemies and from the people who want to catch me. and be kind to me! Keep me safe, because of your faithful love. I call to you for help. Cause evil people to become ashamed. Let them go to their graves and be silent there! They insult righteous people. They are proud people, and they boast about themselves. to bless people who respect you. While everyone watches, you bless those who come to you for help. and you keep them safe with you.

That makes me feel very sad and upset . I wore rough clothes, and I stopped eating food. I bent down my head as I prayed for them. as I would weep when a friend or my mother had died. they were happy. They stood together and they laughed at me. Even strangers attacked me and they would not stop. and they showed their teeth to frighten me. as they do this to me? Keep me safe when they attack me. They attack me like hungry lions . Do not let them kill me! in the great meeting of your people. I will thank you so that everyone hears me. Do not let them win against me, and be happy. They have no reason to hate me, so do not let them laugh at me. Instead, they try to deceive people who want to live quietly. to speak against me. We have seen the bad things that you do!&quot; Do not remain silent , my Lord . Do not stay far away from me. Show that I am not guilty , my Lord and my God. Give me justice, my God. Do not let them laugh at me. &quot;Aha! This is what we wanted.&quot; Do not let them say, &quot;We have eaten him alive!&quot; Make them ashamed and confused! Bring down those proud people who laugh at me. Make them feel very ashamed. let them shout aloud in their pleasure. May they always say, &quot;The Lord is great! He is happy when his servant is safe and well!&quot; I will praise you all through each day."

When I am in trouble, you keep me safe. I will sing songs to praise you. You, God, are my strong, safe place. You are the God who loves me with a faithful love."

Our ancestors have told them to us, We will tell our children and our grandchildren why they should praise the Lord . We will tell them about his strength , and about the great things that he has done. the Israelite people. He commanded our ancestors to teach them to their children. even the children still to be born. When the time came, they too would tell their children. They would not forget what God had done. They would obey his commands. who turned against God. Those people refused to obey God, and they did not trust him to be their guide. that God had made with them. They refused to obey his laws. They forgot the miracles that he had shown them. in the region of Egypt that is called Zoan. and he led them through it. so that his people had plenty of water. Springs of water came from deep in the earth. In the wilderness, they turned against the Most High God. to see what he would do. They demanded to have the food that they liked best. &quot;Can God give us food to eat here in the wilderness? There were streams of water that poured out like a river. But can he also give us food to eat? Can he supply meat for his people?&quot; he was very angry. So he sent fire to punish his people. He became very angry against the Israelites. that he had the power to save them. to give food to his people. He caused the skies to open like a door. God gave them all the food that they could eat. He used his power to send a south wind too. like dust from the sky. The birds covered all the ground where his people were living. Yes, God gave them what they had demanded! even before they had finished eating. While the food was still in their mouths, he killed the strongest men among them. Many of the best young Israelite men died. the people continued to do bad things. When God had done these miracles , they still did not trust him to help them. They became very afraid. the other people turned to God. They were sorry and they prayed to him. was their strong Rock. They remembered that the Most High God was their Redeemer . What they said to him was lies . They did not obey the covenant that he had made with them. and he forgave them for their sins . He did not destroy them. Many times he was patient, and he did not become angry with them. like a wind that blows away and does not return. they often turned against God. That caused God to be very sad. so that he was very upset . and how he rescued them from their enemies. in the region of Zoan. He destroyed their fig trees with frost . that he sent terrible things to punish them. Great trouble came to them, like an army of his angels that bring death. He did not save them from death. He let bad disease kill them. But took them through the wilderness , and they were not afraid. It was land with the mountain He gave to each tribe their own piece of land, and they turned against him. as their ancestors had done. They were useless , like a bow that would not shoot straight! made God very angry. and he became very angry. He turned against the Israelite people. he let their enemies kill them in battle . There was nobody for the young women to marry. Their widows had no chance to weep. like someone had woken him from sleep. He shouted loudly, like a soldier who has drunk a lot of wine . He caused them to be ashamed for ever. He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. He chose Mount Zion , the place which he loves. to be like his home in heaven . He made it to be strong, like the earth itself, so that it would always be there. He took David away from the fields, He became like a shepherd , to lead his people, Jacob's descendants. He ruled the people that belonged to God, He was wise in the way that he led them."

Be kind and send help to us quickly. We are in a lot of trouble! Rescue us, so that people will respect your great name. Forgive our sins , so that people know you are good. &quot;Their God cannot help them!&quot; That is not right! People of those nations have murdered your servants, so punish them for us to see. They are calling out for help. Use your great power to make them free, before their enemies kill them. have insulted you. Punish them as they deserve , seven times over! Give them as much trouble as they have given to you. You take care of us, as the sheep in your field. We will tell our children and grandchildren to praise you, as you deserve."

They took with them valuable silver and gold things. Nobody among the Israelite people was too weak to go. and a fire to give them light at night. he gave them quails to eat. He fed them with bread from the sky. so that water poured out from it. It ran as a river through the dry places. that he had made to his servant, Abraham. and they were very happy! They were the people that he had chosen for himself, and they shouted with joy ! the land of other nations . They enjoyed the good things that other people had worked to get. and his laws.

They ate the food from sacrifices that people gave to dead idols . because of what his people did. He sent a bad disease among them. and that will be true for ever. What they did there caused Moses to have trouble. to destroy the nations of Canaan, But they did not obey the Lord 's command. and they learned their way of life. which caught them in a trap . as sacrifices for those idols of demons ! but they killed them as sacrifices for the idols of Canaan. Those murders made the land unclean . made them unclean . They were not faithful to the Lord , like a wife who is not faithful to her husband. They belonged to him but he turned away from them. Their enemies ruled over them. and they were cruel to them. but they had decided not to obey him. Their sins made them weaker and weaker. He answered them when they called to him for help.
