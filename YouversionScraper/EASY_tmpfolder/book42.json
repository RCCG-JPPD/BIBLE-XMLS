He will do the things that he promised in his holy covenant . Then you can serve me and not be afraid. &quot;You, my child, will be called a prophet of the powerful God who is over all.

The wind stopped immediately and the water became flat. All this frightened the disciples and they were very surprised. They asked each other, &quot;Who is this man? He even tells the wind and the water what to do. He speaks and they obey him!&quot; The bad spirit had often taken hold of the man, so people watched him carefully. They held his feet with metal chains . But when the bad spirit took hold of him, he often broke the chains. The bad spirit then caused him to go into the wilderness . So the man went away. He went everywhere in the town and told all the people, &quot;Jesus has done very good things for me.&quot; So Jesus went along. A crowd of people went with him. They were pushing against him. Everyone round him said, &quot;It was not me. I did not touch you.&quot; Then Peter said to Jesus, &quot;Master, there is a big crowd round you. Many people are pushing against you.&quot;"
