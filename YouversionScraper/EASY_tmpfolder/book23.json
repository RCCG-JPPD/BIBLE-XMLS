The people that we sent to make peace with our enemies are weeping. Nobody is travelling anywhere. People spoil agreements that they have made. They do not believe what people promise. They do not respect anyone. Lebanon's forest is dying. Sharon has become like a desert . I will show that I am great and powerful. Your thoughts are like dry grass and straw . Your own breath will destroy you, like a fire that burns dry grass. and only ashes will remain. They will burn as easily as thorn bushes that people cut down and throw on the fire. listen to what I have done! You people who are near, understand that I am very strong.&quot; The people who do not respect God shake with fear . They ask, &quot;Who among us can stay alive? This is a fire that burns everything. Nobody can stop it from burning!&quot; Those who are honest in what they do and fair in what they say. Those who refuse to cheat other people so that they can become rich. Those who refuse to accept bribes . Those who will not listen to murderers , and who will not think about evil things. Danger will not reach them among the high rocks. They will always have food to eat, and plenty of water to drink. He will be great and beautiful. You will see the land that he rules. It will reach far and wide. You will say, &quot;Where is the enemy's important officer? Where is the officer that we paid taxes to? Where is the officer who counted our strong buildings? They are no longer here to give us trouble!&quot; You could not understand their language. They laughed at you with strange words. Yes, you will see Jerusalem. It will be a place that is quiet and safe. It will be like a tent that people will never move. They will never pull up its pegs . They will never break its ropes . Rivers and wide streams will run through it. Our enemies will not be able to bring their ships there to attack us. He is our judge , our ruler and our king. You have not tied the ropes . There is nowhere to hang the sails . But then, you will take many valuable things from your enemies. You will share them after the battle. Even people who cannot walk well will carry away what they want! And God will forgive their sins . other nations will deceive you. The trees in Bashan and Carmel have no leaves."

The Lord has made them pay for their sins . He has made them pay twice.&quot; &quot;Prepare a way in the wilderness for the Lord . Make a straight road in the desert for our God. and bring down every mountain and hill. The rough ground and the ground that has rocks will become flat. All people will see it at the same time. The Lord himself has promised this.&quot; But I say, &quot;What should I shout?&quot; &quot;Shout that all people are like grass. Their promises are like the flowers in a field. and flowers fall to the ground. The Lord causes this to happen, when he sends a wind to blow on them. It is true. People are like grass. and flowers fall to the ground. But God's promise will be true for ever.&quot; So go up onto a high mountain. Yes, Jerusalem, shout the good news! Shout aloud, and do not be afraid. Say to the towns in Judah, &quot;Here is your God!&quot; He will use his great strength to rule the people. Look again! He is bringing his gifts with him. He brings the prize that he has won in battle . He picks up the young lambs and he carries them near to his heart. He carefully leads the mother sheep that have lambs. He measured all the water of the seas in one hand. He used his hand to measure the whole sky. He carefully weighed the soil of the earth. He carefully weighed the mountains in his scales , and the hills too. Nobody can be his advisor , to tell him what he should do. Nobody can teach him the proper way to do things. Nobody can give him knowledge . Nobody can teach him how to understand things. as if they are a little bit of water in a bucket. They are like dust on his scales . He weighs the islands as he would weigh dust. to make a fire for his altar . All its animals are not enough to offer to him as burnt offerings . He sees them as empty and useless . There is no image that you can make to be like him. Another worker may cover it with gold. He may use silver chains to make it beautiful. He chooses wood that will not quickly become spoiled . Then he finds a worker to make an idol for him. He makes it so that it will not fall over! You must have heard about it. Somebody must have told you these things from the beginning. You should have understood it all since the time that God made the earth. where the earth and the sky meet. The people on the earth seem like grasshoppers to him. He hangs out the sky like a curtain. He makes it like a tent for him to live in. He causes the rulers of the world to be useless . Somebody plants them in the ground. But while their roots are still growing into the soil , God blows on them and they become dry. Then the wind carries them away like straw . &quot;You cannot find anyone who is like me. Nobody is the same as me.&quot; Think about the one who made all the stars. God is the one who brought together that great army! He knows how many they are and he knows each of their names! When he calls them, each one is there, because he is so strong and powerful. &quot;The Lord does not know about our troubles. He does not bring justice to us.&quot; Why do you say that? You must have heard about it. The Lord is the God who lives for ever. He made the whole earth, near and far. He never becomes tired or weak. He knows and he understands everything. When people have become weak, he gives them more strength . Even strong young men may slip and fall down. will receive new strength . They will rise up high, as if they have the wings of eagles . They will run and they will not become tired. They will walk and they will not become weak."

Those who live in lands far away should praise him for what he has done. like a brave soldier. He is angry with his enemies, and he is ready to attack them. He shouts loudly as he attacks, and he shows his power over them. &quot;I have been quiet for a long time. I have held back my anger. But now I am ready to deliver! I will cry out and shout and groan , like a woman who is ready to give birth. I will cause the plants that grow on them to die. I will cause the rivers to become dry islands. I will cause the pools of water to become dry. along ways that they did not know before. I will be their guide, as they walk along paths that are new to them. I will change the dark places that are in front of them, so that they become places with light. And I will cause the rough ground to become flat. Those are the things that I will do for them. I will not leave my people alone. Those people will become ashamed. They say to images that they have made, &apos;You are our gods.&apos; Look at this, you blind people! Who is deaf? Nobody is as deaf as the one who takes my message. The people that I agreed a covenant with are blind! Yes, the servant of the Lord is truly blind! but you do not understand them. You have opened your ears to listen, but you have not really heard anything.&quot; Will you think carefully about it in the future? under the power of their enemies? Who gave the Israelites to people who would rob them? It was the Lord ! He is the one that we have not obeyed. His people did not live in the way that he wanted. They did not obey his law . He punished them with a cruel war. His anger was like a fire all round them, but they did not understand what he was doing. His anger burned them, but they did not learn their lesson."

When you cross dangerous rivers, you will not drown. When you walk through fire, it will not burn you. so I will rescue you. I am Israel's Holy God, your Saviour . I gave Egypt as the price to buy you back. I gave Ethiopia and Seba to their enemies, so that you could be free. You are my special people, and I love you. So I will give other people to their enemies, to keep your lives safe. Other nations will pay the price, instead of you. so do not be afraid. I will bring your descendants from the east. I will also bring you together from the west. &apos;Give them back!&apos; And I will say to people in the south, &apos;Do not stop them!&apos; Bring my sons from places that are far away. Bring my daughters from the ends of the earth. I created them, so that they would bring honour to me. I made them who they are. Yes, I made them! They have eyes, but they are blind !

Then they can tell us that they were right. People could say, &apos;They spoke the truth.&apos; &quot; &quot;You are the people who must say that I am right. I have chosen you as my servant. I chose you so that you may know me, and also believe in me. Then you would understand that I am the true God. There has never been any other god except me, and there never will be. There is no other saviour , except me. and I did what I said I would do. I told everyone what I had done. There was no foreign god among you, who did that for you. So you are the people who must say that I am the only true God.&quot; That is what the Lord says. If I hold you in my hand, nobody can take you away from my power.

I am your King.&quot; &quot;Forget those things that happened a long time ago. Do not think about past events. It is already beginning to happen. Surely, you can recognize it.

They praise me because I put water in the desert, and streams in the wilderness. I am giving water to the people that I have chosen, so that they will not be thirsty . so that they would praise me aloud. you did not call to me to help you. You became tired of serving me. You did not make sacrifices to me, to show that you respect me. I did not make it difficult for you, when I asked you to bring offerings to me. When I asked you to burn incense to worship me, that should not have made you tired. to offer them to me. You did not bring me the fat from your sacrifices to make me happy. Instead, you have made it difficult for me, because of all your sins . All the evil things that you do have caused me to become very tired. when you do not obey me. I, the Lord , do that, because of who I am. I do not hold your sins in my mind. Show me why you think that you are right! Your leaders and teachers turned against me. to become ashamed.

I will not let people insult my good name. I will not let anyone else share my glory . I called you to belong to me, you Israelite people. I am the only One. I am the first, and I am also the last. With my right hand, I hung up the sky like a curtain. When I call to the stars, they all appear in their places. Not one of your idols has said what will happen now. I, the Lord , have chosen a friend to attack Babylon . He will do what I want. He will have the power to punish the Babylonians . I have called him to do this work. I have shown him what he must do, and he will do it! From the beginning, I have not spoken secretly. When these things happen, I will already be there.&quot; &quot;I am the Lord your God. I teach you what will be good for you. I lead you along a good path in life. Then you would have had peace in your lives, like a river that runs quietly. You would have been safe and well, like the strong waves in the sea. as much as the sand on the shore of the sea. I would not need to destroy them.

They will have all the food that they need. I shake the sea so that its waves roar ! My name is the Lord Almighty. to speak on my behalf. I have kept you safe in my hand. I hung up the sky like a curtain, and I made the foundation of the earth. I say to Zion , &apos;You are my people.&apos; &quot; The Lord has been angry with you, and he has punished you. You had to receive all of his anger , like you were drinking strong wine from a cup. Now that you have drunk it all, you cannot stand up straight! there was nobody left to be your leader. There was nobody who could take care of you. Both those terrible things have happened to you. Who feels sorry for you? Who is there to comfort you? and they lie on the ground at the side of every street. They are like deer that a trap has caught. The anger of the Lord your God has made them helpless . He has warned them loudly. You walk like drunk people, but wine has not done that to you. &quot;Look! Now I have taken the cup of my punishment out of your hand. You will no longer have to drink the strong wine of my anger that makes you drunk. to punish them. They said to you, &apos;Lie down on the ground, so that we can walk over you.&apos; You made your backs become like the ground. You became like a street for your enemies to walk on.&quot; Think about the rock that you are a part of. Remember how you cut the monster , Rahab, into pieces. could then cross over."

Yes, God will completely forgive them, if they turn back to him. &quot;Remember! My thoughts are not the same as your thoughts. The way that you do things is not the same as the way that I do things. In the same way, I do things in a much better way than you do. Also, my thoughts are much higher than your thoughts. and they do not immediately return there. Instead, they give water to the earth, so that crops will grow there. Then the farmer has seeds to plant, and people have food to eat. It will not return to me without any result. No! My word does what I want it to do. What I promise to do will certainly happen.&quot; You will travel home with peace in your minds. The mountains and the hills will sing with joy as you travel past. The trees in the fields will clap their hands together! pine trees will grow instead. Myrtle bushes will grow where there are weeds now. Those things will show everyone that the Lord is great. It will be a sign to people for ever. You do not need to pay any money. It is free!"
