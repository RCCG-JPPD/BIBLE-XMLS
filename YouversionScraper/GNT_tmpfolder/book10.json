He protects me like a shield; he defends me and keeps me safe. He is my savior; he protects me and saves me from violence. and he saves me from my enemies. Praise the Lord ! the waves of destruction rolled over me. and the grave set its trap for me. I called to my God for help. In his temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help. the foundations of the sky rocked and quivered because God was angry! a consuming flame and burning coals from his mouth. with a dark cloud under his feet. he traveled on the wings of the wind. and the voice of Almighty God was heard. with flashes of lightning he sent them running. and the foundations of the earth were uncovered when the Lord rebuked his enemies and roared at them in anger. he pulled me out of the deep waters. and from all those who hate me&ndash; they were too strong for me. but the Lord protected me. he saved me because he was pleased with me. he blesses me because I am innocent. I have not turned away from my God. I have not disobeyed his commands. that I have kept myself from doing wrong. because he knows that I am innocent. but hostile to those who are wicked. but you humble those who are proud. you dispel my darkness. and power to overcome their defenses. how dependable his words! He is like a shield for all who seek his protection. God alone is our defense. he keeps me safe on the mountains. so that I can use the strongest bow. your help has made me great. and I have never fallen. I do not stop until I destroy them. they lie defeated before me. and victory over my enemies. I destroy those who hate me. they call to the Lord , but he does not answer. I trample on them like mud in the streets. and maintained my rule over the nations; people I did not know have now become my subjects. when they hear me, they obey. Proclaim the greatness of the strong God who saves me! he subdues the nations under me O Lord , you give me victory over my enemies and protect me from violent men. I sing praises to you. he shows constant love to the one he has chosen, to David and his descendants forever."
