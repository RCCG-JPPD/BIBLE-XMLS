No woman could keep from loving you. be my king and take me to your room. We will be happy together, drink deep, and lose ourselves in love. No wonder all women love you! dark as the desert tents of Kedar, but beautiful as the draperies in Solomon's palace. because the sun has tanned me. My brothers were angry with me and made me work in the vineyard. I had no time to care for myself. Where will you lead your flock to graze? Where will they rest from the noonday sun? Why should I need to look for you Go and follow the flock; find pasture for your goats near the tents of the shepherds. as a mare excites the stallions of Pharaoh's chariots. and falls along your neck like jewels. with ornaments of silver. and my perfume filled the air with fragrance. as he lies upon my breasts. that bloom in the vineyards at Engedi. how your eyes shine with love! how you delight me! The green grass will be our bed; and the cypress trees the ceiling."

He is feeding his flock in the garden and gathering lilies. he feeds his flock among the lilies. as lovely as the city of Tirzah, they are holding me captive. Your hair dances like a flock of goats bounding down the hills of Gilead. that have just been washed. Not one of them is missing; they are all perfectly matched. young women without number! and she is as lovely as a dove. She is her mother's only daughter, her mother's favorite child. All women look at her and praise her; queens and concubines sing her praises. She is beautiful and bright, to see the young plants in the valley, to see the new leaves on the vines and the blossoms on the pomegranate trees. Let us watch you as you dance. Why do you want to watch me as I dance between the rows of onlookers?"
