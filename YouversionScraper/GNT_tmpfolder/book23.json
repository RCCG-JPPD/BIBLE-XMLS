His power is so great&ndash; not one of them is ever missing! that the Lord doesn't know your troubles or care if you suffer injustice? The Lord is the everlasting God; he created all the world.

They will rise on wings like eagles; they will run and not get weary; they will walk and not grow weak."

But now the time to act has come; I cry out like a woman in labor. and dry up the grass and trees. and dry up the pools of water. by roads they have never traveled. I will turn their darkness into light and make rough country smooth before them. These are my promises, and I will keep them without fail. who call images their gods, will be humiliated and disgraced.&apos; &apos;Listen, you deaf people! Look closely, you that are blind! more deaf than the messenger I send? but what has it meant to you? You have ears to hear with, but what have you really heard?&apos; so he exalted his laws and teachings, and he wanted his people to honor them. they are locked up in dungeons and hidden away in prisons. They were robbed and plundered, with no one to come to their rescue. From now on will you listen with care? It was the Lord himself, against whom we sinned! We would not live as he wanted us to live or obey the teachings he gave us. and suffer the violence of war. Like fire his anger burned throughout Israel, but we never knew what was happening; we learned nothing at all from it."

The soldier's prisoners will be taken away, and the tyrant's loot will be seized. I will fight against whoever fights you, and I will rescue your children. they will be drunk with murder and rage.
