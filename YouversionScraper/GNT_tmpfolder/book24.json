No male that wants her has to trouble himself; she is always available in mating season. or let your throat become dry from chasing after other gods. But you say, ‘No! I can't turn back.

If you can't even stand up in open country, how will you manage in the jungle by the Jordan? they join in the attacks against you. Do not trust them, even though they speak friendly words.” “I have abandoned Israel; I have rejected my chosen nation. I have given the people I love into the power of their enemies. like a lion in the forest they have roared at me, and so I hate them. attacked from all sides by hawks. Call the wild animals to come and join in the feast! they have trampled down my fields; they have turned my lovely land into a desert. it lies desolate before me. The whole land has become a desert, and no one cares. people have come to plunder. I have sent war to destroy the entire land; no one can live in peace. they have worked hard, but got nothing for it.
