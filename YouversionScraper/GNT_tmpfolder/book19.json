I have not turned away from my God. I have not disobeyed his commands. that I have kept myself from doing wrong. because he knows that I am innocent. completely good to those who are perfect. but hostile to those who are wicked. but you humble those who are proud. you dispel my darkness. and power to overcome their defenses.

God alone is our defense. who makes my pathway safe. he keeps me safe on the mountains. so that I can use the strongest bow. your care has made me great, and your power has kept me safe. and I have never fallen. I do not stop until I destroy them. they lie defeated before me. and victory over my enemies. I destroy those who hate me. they call to the Lord , but he does not answer. which the wind blows away. I trample on them like mud in the streets. and made me ruler over the nations; people I did not know have now become my subjects. when they hear me, they obey. and come trembling from their fortresses. Proclaim the greatness of the God who saves me. he subdues the nations under me O Lord , you give me victory over my enemies and protect me from violent people. I sing praises to you. he shows constant love to the one he has chosen, to David and his descendants forever."

Many times he held back his anger and restrained his fury. like a wind that blows by and is gone. how many times they made him sad! and brought pain to the Holy God of Israel. and the day when he saved them from their enemies in the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt. and the Egyptians had no water to drink. and frogs that ruined their land. and to destroy their fields. and their fig trees with frost. by pouring out his anger and fierce rage, which came as messengers of death. or spare their lives, but killed them with a plague. of all the families of Egypt. and guided them through the desert. but the sea came rolling over their enemies. to the mountains which he himself conquered. he divided their land among the tribes of Israel and gave their homes to his people. and put him to the test. They did not obey his commandments, unreliable as a crooked arrow. and with their idols they made him furious. so he rejected his people completely. the home where he had lived among us. the symbol of his power and glory. and let them be killed by their enemies. and young women had no one to marry. and their widows were not allowed to mourn. he was like a strong man excited by wine. in lasting and shameful defeat. he did not select the tribe of Ephraim. and Mount Zion, which he dearly loves. like his home in heaven; he made it firm like the earth itself, secure for all time. he took him from the pastures, and he made him king of Israel, the shepherd of the people of God. and led them with skill."

How much longer, Lord ? and boast about their crimes? they oppress those who belong to you. and murder the strangers who live in our land. the God of Israel does not notice.” When will you ever learn? He made our eyes—can't he see? He is the teacher of us all—hasn't he any knowledge? he knows how senseless our reasoning is. the ones to whom you teach your law! until a pit is dug to trap the wicked. he will not desert those who belong to him. and all righteous people will support it. Who took my side against the evildoers? but your constant love, O Lord , held me up. you comfort me and make me glad. who make injustice legal, and sentence the innocent to death. my God protects me. and destroy them for their sins; the Lord our God will destroy them."
