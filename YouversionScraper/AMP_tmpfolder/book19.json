And cried to my God for help; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry for help came before Him, into His very ears. The foundations of the mountains trembled; They were shaken because He was indignant and angry. And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it. And thick darkness was under His feet. And He sped on the wings of the wind. The darkness of the waters, the thick clouds of the skies. Hailstones and coals of fire. And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire. And He sent an abundance of lightning flashes and confused and routed them [in defeat]. And the foundations of the world were laid bare At Your rebuke, O L ord , At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. He drew me out of many waters. And from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me. But the L ord was my support. He rescued me because He was pleased with me and delighted in me. According to the cleanness of my hands He has rewarded me. And have not wickedly departed from my God. And I did not put away His statutes from me. And I kept myself free from my sin. According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight. With the blameless You show Yourself blameless, And with the crooked You show Yourself astute. But bring down those [arrogant fools] with haughty eyes. The L ord my God illumines my darkness. And by my God I can leap over a wall. The word of the L ord is tested [it is perfect, it is faultless]; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. Or who is a rock, except our God, And makes my way blameless? He sets me [securely] upon my high places. So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. And Your right hand upholds and sustains me; Your gentleness [Your gracious response when I pray] makes me great. So that my feet will not slip. And I did not turn back until they were consumed. They fell [wounded] under my feet. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. And I silenced and destroyed those who hated me. Even to the L ord [they cried], but He did not answer them. I emptied them out as the dirt of the streets. You have placed me as the head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me. Foreigners feign obedience to me. And come trembling out of their strongholds. And may the God of my salvation be exalted, And subdues peoples (nations) under me. Yes, You lift me up above those who rise up against me; You deliver me from the man of violence. And sing praises to Your name. And shows steadfast love and mercy to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever."

But [we will] tell to the generation to come the praiseworthy deeds of the L ord , And [tell of] His great might and power and the wonderful works that He has done. And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers That they should teach to their children [the great facts of God&quot;s transactions with Israel], May arise and recount them to their children, And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not prepare its heart to know and follow God, And whose spirit was not faithful to God. Yet they turned back in the day of battle. And refused to walk according to His law; And His miraculous wonders that He had shown them. In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan [where Pharaoh resided]. And He made the waters stand up like [water behind] a dam. And all the night with a light of fire. And gave them abundant [water to] drink like the ocean depths. And caused waters to run down like rivers. By rebelling against the Most High in the desert. By asking for food according to their [selfish] appetite. They said, &apos;Can God prepare [food for] a table in the wilderness? And the streams overflowed; Can He give bread also? Or will He provide meat for His people?&apos; A fire was kindled against Jacob, And His anger mounted up against Israel, And they did not trust in His salvation (His power to save). And opened the doors of heaven; And gave them the grain of heaven. God sent them provision in abundance. And by His [unlimited] power He guided the south wind. And winged birds (quail) like the sand of the seas. Around their tents. He gave them what they craved. And while their food was in their mouths, And killed some of the strongest of them, And subdued the choice young men of Israel. For they did not believe in His wonderful and extraordinary works. And their years in sudden terror. And they returned [to Him] and searched diligently for God [for a time]. And the Most High God their Redeemer. And lied to Him with their tongues. Nor were they faithful to His covenant. Many times He restrained His anger And did not stir up all His wrath. A wind that goes and does not return. And grieved Him in the desert! And distressed the Holy One of Israel. Nor the day when He redeemed them from the enemy, And His wonders in the field of Zoan [where Pharaoh resided], And their streams, so that they could not drink. And frogs which destroyed them. And the fruit of their labor to the locust. And their sycamore trees with frost. And their flocks and herds to thunderbolts. His fury and indignation and distress, A band of angels of destruction [among them]. He did not spare their souls from death, But turned over their lives to the plague. The first and best of their strength in the tents [of the land of the sons] of Ham. And guided them in the wilderness like [a good shepherd with] a flock. But the sea engulfed their enemies. To this mountain [Zion] which His right hand had acquired. And allotted their land as an inheritance, measured out and partitioned; And He had the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents [the tents of those who had been dispossessed]. And did not keep His testimonies (laws). They were twisted like a warped bow [that will not respond to the archer&quot;s aim]. And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images [by denying Him the love, worship, and obedience that is rightfully and uniquely His]. And utterly rejected Israel, [greatly hating her ways], The tent in which He had dwelled among men, And His glory into the hand of the enemy (the Philistines). And was infuriated with His inheritance (Israel). And His [bereaved] virgins had no wedding songs. And His widows could not weep. Like a [mighty] warrior who awakens from the sleep of wine [fully conscious of his power]. He subjected them to lasting shame and dishonor. And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim [in which the tabernacle stood]. Mount Zion, which He loved [to replace Shiloh as His capital]. Like the earth which He has established forever. And took him from the sheepfolds; To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance. And guided them with his skillful hands."

And all that the earth produces for cultivation by man, So that he may bring food from the earth&ndash; So that he may make his face glisten with oil, And bread to sustain and strengthen man&quot;s heart. The cedars of Lebanon which He has planted, As for the stork, the fir trees are her house. The sun knows the [exact] place of its setting. In which prowls about every wild beast of the forest. And seek their food from God. And lie down in their dens. And remains at his labor until evening. In wisdom You have made them all; The earth is full of Your riches and Your creatures. In which are swarms without number, Creatures both small and great. And Leviathan [the sea monster], which You have formed to play there. To give them their food in its appointed season. You open Your hand, they are filled and satisfied with good [things]. You take away their breath, they die And return to their dust. You renew the face of the ground. May the L ord rejoice and be glad in His works&ndash; He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. As for me, I will rejoice and be glad in the L ord . And let the wicked be no more. Bless and affectionately praise the L ord , O my soul. Praise the L ord ! (Hallelujah!)"

And ate sacrifices offered to the dead. And a plague broke out among them. And so the plague was halted. To all generations forever. So that it went hard with Moses on their account; Moses spoke recklessly with his lips. As the L ord commanded them, And learned their ways, Which became a [dreadful] snare to them. Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with their blood. They played the prostitute in their own deeds [by giving their worship, which belongs to God alone, to other &apos;gods&apos;]. And those who hated them ruled over them. And they were subdued under the [powerful] hand of their enemies. But they were rebellious in their counsel, And sank down in their wickedness. When He heard their cry; And relented [rescinding their sentence] according to the greatness of His lovingkindness [when they cried out to Him], Among those who had carried them away captive. And gather us from among the nations, That we may give thanks to Your holy name And glory in praising You. From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, &apos;Amen.&apos; Praise the L ord ! (Hallelujah!)"

When I learn [through discipline] Your righteous judgments [for my transgressions]. Do not utterly abandon me [when I fail]. By keeping watch [on himself] according to Your word [conforming his life to Your precepts]. Do not let me wander from Your commandments [neither through ignorance nor by willful disobedience].

And [thoughtfully] regard Your ways [the path of life established by Your precepts]. I will not forget Your word. That I may live and keep Your word [treasuring it and being guided by it day by day]. Wonderful things from Your law. Do not hide Your commandments from me. For Your ordinances at all times. Who wander from Your commandments. For I observe Your testimonies. Your servant meditates on Your statutes. And my counselors. Revive and refresh me according to Your word. Teach me Your statutes. So that I will meditate (focus my thoughts) on Your wonderful works. Renew and strengthen me according to [the promises of] Your word. And graciously grant me Your law. I have placed Your ordinances before me . O L ord , do not put me to shame! For You will give me a heart that is willing. And I will [steadfastly] observe it to the end. And observe it with all my heart. For I delight in it. And not to dishonest gain and envy. And restore me [with renewed energy] in Your ways. As that which produces [awe-inspired] reverence for You. For Your ordinances are good. Renew me through Your righteousness. Your salvation according to Your promise; For I trust [completely] in Your word [and its reliability]. For I wait for Your ordinances. Forever and ever [writing Your precepts on my heart].

That I observe Your precepts [accepting them with loving obedience]. I have promised to keep Your words. Be merciful and gracious to me according to Your promise. And turned my feet to [follow and obey] Your testimonies. To keep Your commandments. But I have not forgotten Your law. Because of Your righteous ordinances. And of those who keep and honor Your precepts. Teach me Your statutes. O L ord , according to Your promise. For I have believed and trusted and relied on Your commandments. But now I keep and honor Your word [with loving obedience]. Teach me Your statutes. But I will keep Your precepts with all my heart. But I delight in Your law. That I may learn Your statutes. Than thousands of gold and silver pieces. Give me understanding and a teachable heart, that I may learn Your commandments. Because I wait for Your word. And that in faithfulness You have disciplined me. According to Your word (promise) to Your servant. For Your law is my delight. But I will meditate on Your precepts. Even those who have known Your testimonies. So that I will not be ashamed. I wait for Your word. Saying, &apos;When will You comfort me?&apos; Yet I do not forget Your statutes. When will You execute judgment on those who persecute me? Men who do not conform to Your law. They have persecuted me with a lie; help me [L ord ]! So that I may keep and obey the testimony of Your mouth. Your word is settled in heaven [standing firm and unchangeable]. You have established the earth, and it stands [securely]. For all things [all parts of the universe] are Your servants. Then I would have perished in my time of trouble. For by them You have revived me and given me life. For I have [diligently] sought Your precepts and required them [as my greatest need]. But I will consider Your testimonies. Your commandment is exceedingly broad and extends without limits [into eternity]. It is my meditation all the day. For Your words are always with me. For Your testimonies are my meditation. Because I have observed and kept Your precepts. That I may keep Your word. For You Yourself have taught me. Sweeter than honey to my mouth! Therefore I hate every false way. And a light to my path. That I will keep Your righteous ordinances. Renew and revive me [giving me life], O L ord , according to Your word. And teach me Your ordinances. Yet I do not forget Your law. Yet I do not wander from Your precepts. For they are the joy of my heart. Forever, even to the end. But I love and treasure Your law. I wait for Your word.

For their deceitfulness is useless. Therefore I love Your testimonies. And I am afraid and in awe of Your judgments. Do not leave me to those who oppress me. Do not let the arrogant oppress me. And for [the fulfillment of] Your righteous word. And teach me Your statutes. That I may know Your testimonies. They have broken Your law. Yes, more than refined gold. I hate every false way. Therefore my soul keeps them. Their unfolding gives understanding to the simple (childlike). Because I longed for Your commandments. As is Your way to those who love Your name. Do not let any human weakness have power over me [causing me to be separated from You]. That I may keep Your precepts. And teach me Your statutes. Because people do not keep Your law. And upright are Your judgments. And in great faithfulness. Because my enemies have forgotten Your words. Therefore Your servant loves it. But I do not forget Your precepts. And Your law is truth. Yet Your commandments are my delight and my joy. Give me understanding [the ability to learn and a teachable heart] that I may live. I will observe Your statutes. And I will keep Your testimonies. I wait for Your word. That I may meditate on Your word. O L ord , renew and refresh me according to Your ordinances. They are far from Your law. And all Your commandments are truth. That You have founded them forever. For I do not forget Your law. Revive me and give me life according to [the promise of] Your word. For they do not seek Your statutes. Revive me and give me life according to Your ordinances. Yet I do not turn away from Your testimonies. Because they do not respect Your law. Revive me and give me life, O L ord , according to Your lovingkindness. And every one of Your righteous ordinances endures forever. But my heart stands in [reverent] awe of Your words [so I can expect You to help me]. As one who finds great treasure. But I love Your law. Because of Your righteous ordinances. Nothing makes them stumble. And I do Your commandments. I love them greatly. For all my ways are [fully known] before You. Give me understanding [the ability to learn and a teachable heart] according to Your word [of promise]. Deliver me according to Your word. For You teach me Your statutes. For all Your commandments are righteous. For I have chosen Your precepts. And Your law is my delight. And let Your ordinances help me. Seek Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments."
