And justice is never upheld, For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore, justice becomes perverted. Be astonished! Wonder! For I am doing something in your days&ndash; You would not believe it if you were told. That fierce and impetuous nation Who march throughout the earth To take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them. Their justice and authority originate with themselves and are defined only by their decree. And keener than [hungry] wolves in the evening, Their horsemen come galloping, Their horsemen come from far away; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour. Their horde of faces moves [eagerly] forward, They gather prisoners like sand. And rulers are a laughing matter to them. They ridicule every stronghold And heap up rubble [for earth mounds] and capture it. But they will be held guilty, They [and all men] whose own power and strength is their god.&apos; O L ord , my God, My Holy One? We will not die. O L ord , You have appointed the Chaldeans [who rule in Babylon] to execute [Your] judgment, And You, O Rock, have established them to correct and chastise. And You cannot look favorably on wickedness. Why then do You look favorably On those who act treacherously? Why are you silent when the wicked (Chaldean oppressors) destroy Those more righteous than they? Like reptiles and creeping things that have no ruler [and are helpless against their enemies]? And drag them away with a net, And gather them together in their fishing net; So they rejoice and are glad. And burn incense to their fishing net; Because through these things their catch is large and they live luxuriously, And their food is plentiful. And [mercilessly] go on destroying nations without sparing?"

He looked and startled the nations, Yes, the eternal mountains were shattered, The ancient hills bowed low and collapsed. His ways are eternal. The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling. Or was Your anger against the rivers, Or was Your wrath against the [Red] Sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation? The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah (pause, calmly think of that). You split the earth with rivers [bringing waters to dry places]. The downpour of waters swept by [as a deluge]. The deep uttered its voice and raged, It lifted its hands high. They went away at the light of Your [swift] arrows, At the radiance and gleam of Your glittering spear. In anger You trampled and threshed the nations. For the salvation and rescue of Your anointed [people Israel]. To lay him open from the thigh to the neck. Selah (pause, and calmly think of that). The head of his hordes. They stormed out to scatter us, Rejoicing like those Who secretly devour the oppressed [of Israel]. On the surge of many waters. My lips quivered at the sound. Decay and rottenness enter my bones, And I tremble in my place. Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, For the people to arise who will invade and attack us.
