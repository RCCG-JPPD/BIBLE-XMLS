The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh [which he saw in spirit and prophesied]. The L ord avenges and He is full of wrath. The L ord takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies. And He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. The L ord has His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, And the clouds are the dust beneath His feet. He dries up all the rivers [illustrating His judgment]. Bashan [on the east] and [Mount] Carmel [on the west] wither, And [in the north] the blossoms of Lebanon fade. And the hills melt away; Indeed the earth is shaken by His presence— Yes, the world and all that dwell in it. And who can stand up and endure the fierceness of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire And the rocks are destroyed by Him. A strength and stronghold in the day of trouble; He knows [He recognizes, cares for, and understands fully] those who take refuge and trust in Him. And will pursue His enemies into darkness. He will make a complete end of it; Affliction [of God’s people by the hand of Assyria] will not occur twice. And like those drowned in drunkenness, Like stubble completely withered and dry [in the day of the L ord ’ s wrath]. One has gone forth who plotted evil against the L ord , “Though they are at full strength and many in number, Even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you and caused you grief [O Jerusalem], I will afflict you no longer. And I will tear off your shackles.” “Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will cut off the carved idols and cast images From the temple of your gods; I will prepare your grave, For you are vile and unworthy.” Who announces peace and prosperity! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; Perform your vows. For the wicked one [the king of Assyria] will never again pass through you; He is completely cut off."
