For the L ord has spoken: “I have reared and brought up sons, But they have rebelled against Me and have broken away. And the donkey its master’s feeding trough, But Israel does not know [Me as L ord ], My people do not understand.” A people loaded down with wickedness [with sin, with injustice, with wrongdoing], Offspring of evildoers, Sons who behave corruptly! They have abandoned (rejected) the L ord , They have despised the Holy One of Israel [provoking Him to anger], They have turned away from Him. You [only] continue to rebel. The whole head is sick And the whole heart is faint and sick. There is nothing healthy in the nation’s body, Only bruises, welts, and raw wounds, Not pressed out or bandaged, Nor softened with oil [as a remedy]. Your cities are burned with fire, Your fields—strangers are devouring them in your very presence; It is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. Like a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city [isolated, surrounded by devastation]. Had not left us a few survivors, We would be like Sodom, We would be like Gomorrah. You rulers of [another] Sodom, Listen to the law and instruction of our God, You people of [another] Gomorrah. Says the L ord . “I have had enough of [your] burnt offerings of rams And the fat of well-fed cattle [without your obedience]; And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls or lambs or goats [offered without repentance]. Who requires this of you, this trampling of My [temple] courts [by your sinful feet]? [Your] incense is repulsive to Me; [Your] New Moon and Sabbath [observances], the calling of assemblies— I cannot endure wickedness [your sin, your injustice, your wrongdoing] and [the squalor of] the festive assembly. They have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them. I will hide My eyes from you; Yes, even though you offer many prayers, I will not be listening. Your hands are full of blood! Get your evil deeds out of My sight. Stop doing evil, Seek justice, Rebuke the ruthless, Defend the fatherless, Plead for the [rights of the] widow [in court]. Says the L ord . They shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be like wool. You shall eat the best of the land; You shall be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the L ord has spoken. She who was full of justice! Right standing with God once lodged in her, But now murderers. Your wine is diluted with water. And companions of thieves; Everyone loves bribes And chases after gifts. They do not defend the fatherless, Nor does the widow’s cause come before them [instead they delay or turn a deaf ear]. The Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah, I will be freed of My adversaries And avenge Myself on My enemies. And will [thoroughly] purge away your dross as with lye And remove all your tin (impurity). And your counselors as at the beginning; Afterward you will be called the city of righteousness, The faithful city.” And her repentant ones with righteousness. And those who abandon (turn away from) the L ord will be consumed (perish). And you will be ashamed of the gardens [of passion] which you have chosen [for pagan worship]. And like a garden that has no water. And his work a spark. So both will burn together And there will be none to quench them."

When I expected it to produce good grapes, why did it yield worthless ones? I will take away its thorn-hedge, and it will be burned up; It will not be pruned or cultivated, But briars and thorns will come up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.” And the men of Judah are His delightful planting [which He loves]. So He looked for justice, but in fact, [He saw] bloodshed and lawlessness; [He looked] for righteousness, but in fact, [He heard] a cry of distress and oppression. Until there is no more room [for others], So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land! Even great and beautiful ones will be unoccupied. Who stay up late in the night till wine inflames them! But they do not regard nor even pay attention to the deeds of the L ord , Nor do they consider the work of His hands. And their honorable men are famished, And their common people are parched with thirst. And the eyes of the proud (arrogant) will be degraded. And God, the Holy One, will show Himself holy in righteousness [through His righteous judgments]. And strangers will eat in the desolate places of the [exiled] wealthy. And sin as if with cart ropes [towing their own punishment]; And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel approach And come to pass, so that we may know it!” Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! And clever and shrewd in their own sight! And men of strength in mixing intoxicating drinks, And take away the rights of those who are in the right! And the dry grass collapses into the flame, So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away like fine dust; Because they have rejected the law of the L ord of hosts And despised and discarded the word of the Holy One of Israel. And He has stretched out His hand against them and has struck them down. And the mountains trembled, and their dead bodies lay like rubbish in the middle of the streets. In spite of all this God’s anger is not turned away, But His hand is still stretched out [in judgment]. And will whistle for them from the ends of the earth; And indeed, they will come with great speed swiftly. No one slumbers or sleeps; Nor is the belt at their waist undone [as if unprepared for action], Nor is the strap of their sandal broken. Their horses’ hoofs seem like flint and their chariot wheels like a whirlwind. They growl and seize their prey And carry it off and there is no one to save it. And if one looks to the land, in fact, there is darkness and distress; Even the light will be darkened by its clouds."

And I will confuse their strategy, So that they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, And mediums and soothsayers. And a mighty king will rule over them,” declares the Lord G od of hosts. And the river will be parched and dry. The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up, The reeds and the rushes will rot away. And all the sown fields of the Nile Will become dry, be blown away, and be no more. And all those who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn, And those who spread nets upon the waters will languish. And those who weave white cloth will be ashamed. And all those who work for wages will be grieved in soul. The counsel of the Pharaoh’s wisest advisors has become stupid. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings?” Please let them tell you, And let them understand what the L ord of hosts Has purposed against Egypt [if they can]. The princes of Memphis are deluded [and entertain false hope]; Those who are the cornerstone of her tribes Have led Egypt astray.

And a glorious diadem to the [converted] remnant of His people, A strength to those who drive back the battle at the gate. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink; They are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink; They reel while seeing visions, They stagger when pronouncing judgment. And to whom would He explain the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the breast? ‘Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, Rule upon rule, rule upon rule, Here a little, there a little.’ ” By [men with] stammering lips and a foreign tongue, And, “This is the resting place,” yet they would not listen. “Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, Rule upon rule, rule upon rule, Here a little, there a little.” That they may go and stumble backward, and be broken, ensnared, and taken captive. Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem! And with Sheol (the place of the dead) we have made an agreement, When the overwhelming scourge passes by, it will not reach us, For we have made lies our refuge and we have concealed ourselves in deception.” “Listen carefully, I am laying in Zion a Stone, a tested Stone, A precious Cornerstone for the [secure] foundation, firmly placed. And righteousness the mason’s level; Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies And waters will flood over the secret [hiding] place. And your agreement with Sheol (the place of the dead) will not stand; When the overwhelming scourge passes through, Then you will become its trampling ground. For morning after morning it will pass through, by day and by night, And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means.” And the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself [and likewise all their preparations are inadequate]. He will be stirred up as in the Valley of Gibeon, To do His work, His unusual and incredible work, And to accomplish His work, His extraordinary work. Or the bands which bind you will be made stronger; For I have heard from the Lord G od of hosts [a decree] Of decisive destruction on all the earth. Listen carefully and hear my words. Does he continually dig furrows and harrow his ground [after it is prepared]? Does he not sow [the seed of] dill and scatter cumin, And plant wheat in rows, Nor is a cartwheel rolled over cumin; But dill is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a rod. Indeed, the farmer does not continue to thresh it forever. Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually damage it, He does not thresh it longer. Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great."

And the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation and disgrace. And his ambassadors arrive at Hanes [in Egypt]. Who are not a help or benefit, but a shame and also a disgrace.” Through a land of trouble and anguish, They carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys And their treasures on the humps of camels, To a people (Egyptians) who cannot benefit them.

And [you said], “We will ride on swift horses!” Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift. You will flee at the threat of five, Until you are left like a flag on the top of a mountain, And like a signal on a hill. And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. Blessed (happy, fortunate) are all those who long for Him [since He will never fail them]. And His tongue is like a consuming fire. Which reaches to the neck, To sift the nations back and forth in a sieve [of disaster], And to put in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads to ruin. And joy of heart as when one marches [in procession] with a flute, To go to the [temple on the] mountain of the L ord , to the Rock of Israel. And show the descending of His arm [striking] in [His] fierce anger, And in the flame of a devouring fire, In the crashing sound of heavy rain, cloudburst, and hailstones. When He strikes [them] with the rod. Which the L ord will lay on them, Will be to the music of Israel’s tambourines and lyres; And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight Assyria. Indeed, it has been prepared for the [Assyrian] king.

As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; As soon as you stop dealing treacherously, others will deal treacherously with you. Be the arm of Your servants every morning [that is, their strength and their defense], Our salvation also in the time of trouble. At the lifting up of Yourself nations scatter. As locusts swarming so people swarm on it. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. A treasure of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the L ord is your treasure. The ambassadors [seeking a treaty] of peace weep bitterly. He has no regard for [any] man. Lebanon is shamed and [its lush foliage] withers; “Now I will be exalted; now I will be lifted up. My breath is a fire that will consume you. Like thorns cut down which are burned in the fire. And you who are near, acknowledge My might.” Trembling has seized the godless. [They cry] “Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with everlasting burning?” Who rejects gain from fraud and from oppression, Who shakes his hand free from the taking of bribes, Who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed And shuts his eyes to avoid looking upon evil; His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks, His bread will be given him; His water will be permanent. They will see a far-distant land. “Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs [the tribute]? Where is he who counts the towers?” A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a strange and stammering tongue which no one understands. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a undisturbed settlement, A tent which will not be taken down; Not one of its stakes will ever be pulled up, Nor any of its ropes be severed. A place of broad rivers and streams, Where no oar-driven boat will go, And on which no mighty and stately ship will pass. The L ord is our Ruler, The L ord is our King; He will save us. They cannot hold the base of their mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then an abundance of spoil and plunder will be divided; Even the lame will take the plunder. The people who dwell there will be forgiven their wickedness [their sin, their injustice, their wrongdoing]."

And call out to her, that her time of compulsory service in warfare is finished, That her wickedness has been taken away [since her punishment is sufficient], That she has received from the L ord ’ s hand Double [punishment] for all her sins.” “Clear the way for the L ord in the wilderness [remove the obstacles]; Make straight and smooth in the desert a highway for our God. And every mountain and hill be made low; And let the rough ground become a plain, And the rugged places a broad valley. And all humanity shall see it together; For the mouth of the L ord has spoken it.” Then he answered, “What shall I call out?” [The voice answered:] All humanity is [as frail as] grass, and all that makes it attractive [its charm, its loveliness] is [momentary] like the flower of the field. When the breath of the L ord blows upon it; Most certainly [all] the people are [like] grass. But the word of our God stands forever. Get up on a high mountain. O Jerusalem, herald of good news, Lift up your voice with strength, Lift it up, do not fear; Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!” And His arm will rule for Him. Most certainly His reward is with Him, And His restitution accompanies Him. He will gather the lambs in His arm, He will carry them in His bosom; He will gently and carefully lead those nursing their young. And marked off the heavens with a span [of the hand], And weighed the mountains in a balance And the hills in a pair of scales? Or has taught Him as His counselor? Who taught Him the path of justice and taught Him knowledge And informed Him of the way of understanding? And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Now look, He lifts up the islands like fine dust. Nor are its wild beasts enough for a burnt offering [worthy of the L ord ]. They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless. Or with what likeness will you compare Him? A goldsmith overlays it with gold And a silversmith casts its silver chains. Chooses a tree that will not rot; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman To [carve and] set up an idol that will not totter. Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth [the omnipotence of God and the stupidity of bowing to idols]? And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; [It is He] who stretches out the heavens like a veil And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. Who makes the judges (rulers) of the earth meaningless (useless). Scarcely have they been sown, Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth, But He merely blows on them, and they wither, And a strong wind carries them away like stubble. That I would be his equal?” says the Holy One. And see who has created these heavenly bodies, The One who brings out their host by number, He calls them all by name; Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, Not one is missing. “My way is hidden from the L ord , And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God”? The Everlasting God, the L ord , the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become tired or grow weary; There is no searching of His understanding. And to him who has no might He increases power. And vigorous young men stumble badly, Will gain new strength and renew their power; They will lift up their wings [and rise up close to God] like eagles [rising toward the sun]; They will run and not become weary, They will walk and not grow tired."

State your position, that you may be proved right. And your spokesmen [the priests and the prophets—your mediators] have transgressed against Me.

I am the L ord , and there is no other, Causing peace and creating disaster; I am the L ord who does all these things.

My hands, stretched out the heavens, And I commanded all their host. And I will make all his ways smooth; He will build My city and let My exiles go, Without any payment or reward,” says the L ord of hosts. “The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush (ancient Ethiopia) And the Sabeans, men of stature, Will come over to you and they will be yours; They will walk behind you, in chains [of subjection to you] they will come over, And they will bow down before you; They will make supplication to you, [humbly and earnestly] saying, No other God [besides Him].’ ” O God of Israel, Savior! They who make idols will go away together in humiliation. With an everlasting salvation; You will not be put to shame or humiliated for all eternity. “I am the L ord , and there is no one else. In a corner of a land of darkness; I did not say to the descendants of Jacob, ‘Seek Me in vain [with no benefit for yourselves].’ I, the L ord , speak righteousness [the truth—trustworthy, a straightforward correlation between deeds and words], Declaring things that are upright. Come together, you survivors of the nations! They are ignorant, Who carry around their wooden idols [in religious processions or into battle] And keep on praying to a god that cannot save them. Indeed, let them consult together. Who announced this [rise of Cyrus and his conquests] long before it happened? Who declared it long ago? Was it not I, the L ord ? And there is no other God besides Me, A [consistently and uncompromisingly] just and righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me. For I am God, and there is no other. The word is gone out of My mouth in righteousness And shall not return, That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear [allegiance]. To Him people will come, And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame. Will be justified (declared free of guilt) and will glory [in God].”"

As I live,” declares the L ord , “You [Zion] will indeed clothe yourself with all of them as jewels and tie them on as a bride. Certainly now [in the coming years] will be too cramped for the inhabitants, And those who once engulfed you will be far away. ‘The place is too cramped for me’; Make room for me that I may live here . ‘Who has borne me these children, Since I have been bereaved of my children And am barren, an exile and a wanderer?

And their princesses your nurses. They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth And lick the dust of your feet; And you shall know [with an understanding based on personal experience] that I am the L ord ; For they shall not be put to shame who wait and hope expectantly for Me. Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?” “Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away, And the tyrant’s spoils of war will be rescued; For I will contend with your opponent, And I will save your children.

And all our deeds of righteousness are like filthy rags; We all wither and decay like a leaf, And our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing], like the wind, takes us away [carrying us far from God’s favor, toward destruction]. Who awakens and causes himself to take hold of You; For You have hidden Your face from us And have handed us over to the [consuming and destructive] power of our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing]. We are the clay, and You our Potter, And we all are the work of Your hand. Do not remember our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing] forever. Now look, consider, for we are all Your people. Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. Where our fathers praised You, Has been burned by fire; And all our precious objects are in ruins. Will You keep silent and humiliate and oppress us beyond measure?"

I will not keep silent, but I will repay; “Since they too have made offerings with incense on the mountains And scorned and taunted Me on the hills, “As the new wine is found in the cluster, And one says, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing and benefit in it,’ So I will do for the sake of My servants In order not to destroy all of them. And an heir of My mountains from Judah; Even My chosen ones shall inherit it, And My servants will live there.

But you did [what was] evil in My sight And chose that in which I did not delight.” “Listen carefully, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry; Indeed, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty; Indeed, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame. But you will cry out with a heavy heart, And you shall wail and howl from a broken spirit.

Will bless himself by the God of truth and faithfulness; And he who swears [an oath] on the earth Will swear by the God of truth and faithfulness; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My sight. And the former things [of life] will not be remembered or come to mind. Behold, I am creating Jerusalem to be a source of rejoicing And her people a joy. And there will no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.
