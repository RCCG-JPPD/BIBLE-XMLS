And hurries to the place where it rises again. Then circles toward the north; The wind circles and swirls endlessly, And on its circular course the wind returns. Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, There they flow again. Man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing. And that which has been done is that which will be done again. So there is nothing new under the sun. &apos;See this, it is new&apos;? It has already existed for [the vast] ages [of time recorded or unrecorded] Which were before us. Nor also of the later things that are to come; There will be for them no remembrance By generations who will come after them."
