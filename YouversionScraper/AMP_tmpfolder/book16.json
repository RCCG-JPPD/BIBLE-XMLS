May Your glorious name be blessed And exalted above all blessing and praise.” “You are the L ord , You alone; You have made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host (the heavenly bodies), The earth and everything that is on it, The seas and everything that is in them. You give life to all of them, And the heavenly host is bowing down [in worship] to You. Who chose Abram And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, And gave him the name Abraham. To give him the land of the Canaanite, Of the Hittite, of the Amorite, Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite— To give it to his descendants. And You have fulfilled Your promise, For You are righteous and just. And You heard their cry by the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds). Against all his servants and all the people of his land; For You knew that they behaved arrogantly toward them (the Israelites), And You made a name for Yourself, as it is to this day. So that they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; You hurled their pursuers into the depths, Like a stone into mighty and raging waters. And with a pillar of fire by night To light the way for them In which they were to go. And spoke with them from heaven; And You gave them fair ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments. And gave them commandments, statutes, and law, And brought water for them out of a rock for their thirst, And You told them to enter and take possession of They stiffened their necks and would not heed Your commandments. And did not remember Your wondrous acts which You had performed among them; So they stiffened their necks and [in their rebellion] appointed a leader in order to return them to slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of forgiveness, Gracious and merciful and compassionate, And You did not abandon them. And said, ‘This is your god Who brought you up from Egypt,’ And committed great [and contemptible] blasphemies, Did not abandon them in the wilderness; The pillar of the cloud did not leave them by day, To lead them in the way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way they should go. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, And You gave them water for their thirst. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell. And You allotted the kingdoms to them as a boundary. So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon And the land of Og king of Bashan. And You brought them into the land Which You told their fathers to enter and possess. And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, To do with them as they pleased. They took possession of houses full of all good things, Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, So they ate and were filled and became fat, And they reveled and were delighted in Your great goodness. And cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets who warned them To return to You; And they committed great [and contemptible] blasphemies. But when they cried out to You in the time of their suffering and distress, Who rescued them from the hand of their enemies. Therefore You abandoned them into the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them. Yet when they turned and cried out again to You, You heard them from heaven, And You rescued them many times in accordance with Your compassion, Yet they acted presumptuously and arrogantly and did not heed Your commandments, but sinned against Your ordinances, Which by keeping, a man will live. But they turned a stubborn shoulder, stiffened their neck, and would not listen. And admonished them and warned them by Your Spirit through Your prophets; Therefore You gave them into the hand (power) of the peoples of the lands. For You are a gracious and merciful God. Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You, Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people, Since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day. For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly. Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your warnings which You have given them. With Your great goodness which You gave them, With the broad and rich land which You set before them, Did not serve You or turn from their wicked deeds. And as for the land which You gave our fathers, to eat of its fruit and its goodness, Behold, we are slaves in it. Whom You have set over us because of our sins; They also rule over our bodies And over our cattle as they please, So we are in great distress. We are making an agreement in writing; And on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.”"
