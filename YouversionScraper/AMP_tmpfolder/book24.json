The first fruits of His harvest [in which no outsider was allowed to share]. All who ate of it [injuring Israel] became guilty; Evil came on them,” says the L ord .’ ” “What injustice or unrighteousness did your fathers find in Me, That they have wandered far from Me And [habitually] walked after emptiness and futility and became empty? Who brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and of pits, Through a land of drought and of the deep darkness [of the shadow of death], Through a land that no man passed through And where no man lived?’ To eat its fruit and [enjoy] its good things. But you came and defiled My land And you made My inheritance repulsive. And those who deal with the law [given to Moses] did not know Me. The rulers and shepherds also transgressed against Me, And the prophets prophesied by [the authority and in the name of] Baal And walked after [idolatrous] things that did not benefit [them]. “And I will contend with your children’s children.” Send also to Kedar (Arabia) [to the east] and carefully observe and consider And see whether there has been such [a thing] as this! Even though they were not gods [but merely man-made objects]? But My people have exchanged their Glory (the true God) For that [man-made idol] which does not benefit [them]. Be shocked and shudder with horror [at the behavior of the people],” says the L ord . They have abandoned (rejected) Me, The fountain of living water, And they have carved out their own cisterns, Broken cisterns That cannot hold water. Why has he become a captive and a prey? They have made their voices heard and roared loudly. And they have made his land a waste; His cities have been destroyed and are burned ruins, without inhabitant. Have shaved the crown of your head [to degrade you]. By abandoning (rejecting) the L ord your God When He led you in the way? To drink the [muddy] waters of the Nile? Or what are you doing by going to Assyria [in search of an ally], To drink the [muddy] waters of the Euphrates? And your desertion of the faith will punish you. Know therefore that it is an evil and bitter thing For you to abandon (reject) the L ord your God, And for you to be indifferent to Me and dismiss the [reverent] fear of Me,” says the Lord G od of hosts. And tore off your bonds [of the law that I gave you]; You said, ‘I will not serve and obey You!’ For on every high hill And under every green tree You have lain down [in idolatrous worship] like a [compliant] prostitute. A completely faithful seed. How then have you turned against Me Into degenerate shoots of a foreign and wild vine [alien to Me]? And use much soap, The stain of your guilt is [still] before Me [and you are soiled and dirty],” says the Lord G od . I have not gone after [man-made gods like] the Baals’? Look at your way in the valley; Know [without any doubt] what you have done! You are a swift and restless young [female] camel [in the heat of her passion] running here and there, That sniffs the wind in her passion [for the scent of a mate]. In her mating season who can restrain her? No males seeking her need to weary themselves; In her month they will find her [looking for them]. Keep your feet from becoming bare And your throat from becoming dry; But you said, ‘It is hopeless! For I have loved strangers and foreign gods, And I will walk after them.’ So the house of Israel is shamed— They, their kings, their leaders, Their priests, and their prophets— And to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ For they have turned their backs to Me, And not their faces; But in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise [O L ord ] and save us.’ Which you made for yourself? Let them get up, if they can save you In the time of your trouble! For [as many as] the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah. [Why do not your many man-made idols run to help you?] You have all rebelled (transgressed) against Me,” says the L ord . They received no insight from correction [and refused to change]. Your [own] sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion. Have I been a wilderness to Israel [like a land without food], A land of thick and deep darkness [like a path without light]? Why do My people say, ‘We [have broken loose and we] are free to roam [at will]; We will no longer come to You’? Or a bride her attire [that identifies her as a married woman]? Yet My people have forgotten Me Days without number. To seek and obtain [adulterous] love! Even the most wicked of women Have learned [indecent] ways from you. The lifeblood of the innocent poor; You did not find them breaking in [a house]. But in spite of all these things [your disobedience, your love of idolatry, your lack of compassion]— Surely His anger has turned away from me.’ Behold (listen very carefully), I will bring you to judgment and will plead my case against you Because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’ Changing your way? Also, you will be shamed by Egypt As you were shamed by Assyria. With your hands on your head; For the L ord has rejected those in whom you trust (confide), And you will not be successful with them.”"

They will pitch their tents all around her; They will pasture, each one in his place [eating up all her rich grasses]. Arise, let us [take her by surprise and] attack her at noon. But alas, the daylight pales, The evening shadows grow long. And destroy her [fortified] palaces!’ ” “Cut down her trees And build a siege [mound] against Jerusalem. This is the city which must be punished; There is nothing but oppression inside her [walls]. So she [continually] pours out her fresh wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard inside her [walls]; Sickness and wounds are always before Me. Or I will be alienated from you, And make you a desolation, An uninhabited land.” “They will thoroughly gather like [fruit on] a vine what is left of Israel; Pass your hand [over the vine] again and again [Babylon, tool of destruction] like a grape gatherer, Over the branches [stripping the tendrils off the vine].” That they may hear? And they cannot listen. Behold, the word of the L ord has become a reprimand and an object of scorn to them; They have no delight in it. I am tired of restraining it. “[I will] pour it out on the children in the street And on the young men gathered together; For both the husband and wife shall be taken, The aged and the very old [though full of days they are not exempt from judgment]. Their fields and their wives together; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land,” says the L ord . Everyone is greedy for [unfair] gain; And from the prophet even to the priest Everyone deals deceitfully. Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ When there is no peace. No, they were not at all ashamed; They did not even know how to blush [at their idolatry]. Therefore they will fall among those who fall; At the time that I punish them They will be overthrown,” says the L ord . “Stand by the roads and look; ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is; then walk in it, And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it!’ Saying, ‘Listen and pay attention to the [warning] sound of the trumpet!’ But they said, ‘We will not listen.’ And see, O congregation, what [vengeful act] is to be done to them. The fruit of their schemes, Because they have not listened and paid attention to My words, And as for My law, they have rejected it also. And the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable And your sacrifices are not sweet and pleasing to Me.” “Behold, I am laying stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together Will stumble against them; The neighbor and his friend will perish.” “Behold, a people is coming from the north country, And a great nation shall be stirred up and put into action from the remote parts of the earth. They are cruel and inhuman and have no mercy. Their voice sounds like the roaring sea; They ride [in formation] on horses, Arrayed as a man for battle Against you, O Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)!” Our hands become limp and helpless. Anguish has gripped us, Pain like that of a woman in childbirth. Nor walk on the road, For the enemy is armed with the sword; Terror is on every side. Clothe yourself in sackcloth and wallow in ashes; Mourn [aloud] as for an only son, A most bitter cry [of sorrow and regret], For suddenly the destroyer will come upon us [on both prophet and people]. That you may know and analyze their acts.” Going around spreading slander. They are [not gold and silver ore, but] bronze and iron; They are all corrupt. The lead is consumed by the fire; In vain they continue refining, But the wicked are not separated and removed. Because the L ord has rejected them."

Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ When there is no peace. They were not at all ashamed, And they did not know how to blush. Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall; At the time of their punishment they shall be overthrown,” Says the L ord . “There will be no grapes on the vine, Nor figs on the fig tree, And even the leaf will wither; And the things that I have given them will pass away [by the hand of those whom I have appointed].” ’ ” Assemble yourselves, and let us enter the fortified cities And let us die there, For the L ord our God has decreed our ruin And given us bitter and poisonous water to drink, Because we have sinned against the L ord .

Thus says the L ord of hosts, the God of Israel, Kiriathaim has been shamed, it has been captured; Misgab [the high fortress] has been shamed, broken down and crushed. Saying, ‘Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!’ You also, O [city of] Madmen, shall be silenced; The sword will pursue you. ‘Desolation and great destruction!’ Her little ones have called out a cry of distress [to be heard as far as Zoar]. Will be climbed by [successive groups of] fugitives with continual weeping; For on the descent of Horonaim They have heard the distress of the cry of destruction. That you may be like a juniper in the wilderness. Even you yourself will be captured; Together with his priests and his princes. No city will escape. The [Jordan] valley also will be ruined And the plain will be devastated, As the L ord has said. For she will fall into ruins; Her cities (pastures, farms) will be desolate, Without anyone to live in them. And cursed is the one who restrains his sword from blood [in executing the judgment of the L ord ]. He has also been undisturbed, and settled like wine on his dregs, And he has not been emptied from one vessel to another, Nor has he gone into exile. Therefore his flavor remains in him, And his scent has not changed. And valiant men in war?’ And his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,” Says the King, whose name is the L ord of hosts. And his disaster hurries quickly. And all you [distant nations] who know his name; Say, ‘How has the mighty scepter [of national power] been broken, And the splendid staff [of glory]!’ And sit on the parched ground [among the thirsty]! For the destroyer of Moab has advanced against you; He has destroyed your strongholds. Stand by the road and keep watch! Ask [of] him who flees and [ask of] her who escapes, Saying, ‘What has happened?’ Wail and cry out! Tell by [the banks of] the Arnon That Moab has been destroyed. Leave the cities and live among the rocks, And be like the dove that makes her nest In the walls of the yawning ravine. His haughtiness, his arrogance, his conceit, and his self-exaltation. “But it is futile; His idle boasts [in his deeds] have accomplished nothing. And I will cry out for all Moab. I will sigh and mourn over the men of Kir-heres (Kir-hareseth). More than the weeping of Jazer [over its ruins and wasted vineyards]. Your tendrils [of influence] stretched across the sea, Reaching [even] to the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen On your summer fruits and your [season’s] crop of grapes. From the fruitful field and from the land of Moab. And I have made the wine cease from the wine presses; No one treads the grapes with shouting. Their shouting is not joyful shouting [but is instead, a battle cry]. “Behold, one (Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon) will fly swiftly like an eagle And spread out his wings against Moab. And the strongholds seized; And the hearts of the warriors of Moab in that day Shall be like the heart of a woman in childbirth. Because he has become arrogant and magnified himself against the L ord . O inhabitant of Moab,” says the L ord . Will fall into the pit, And the one who gets up out of the pit Will be taken and caught in the trap; For I shall bring upon it, even upon Moab, The year of their punishment,” says the L ord . The fugitives stand powerless [helpless and without strength], For a fire has gone out from Heshbon, A flame from the midst of Sihon; It has destroyed the forehead of Moab And the crowns of the heads of [the arrogant Moabites] the ones in tumult. The people of [the pagan god called] Chemosh have perished; For your sons have been taken away captive And your daughters into captivity. In the latter days,” says the L ord . T hus far is the judgment on Moab. “Woe (judgment is coming) to [the city of] Nebo, for it has been destroyed! In Heshbon they planned evil against her, And Chemosh [your disgusting god cannot rescue you, but] will go away into exile [along with the fugitives] O Daughter living in Dibon,"

Your valley is flowing away, [O Ammon] rebellious and faithless daughter Who trusts in her treasures, saying, ‘Who will come against me?’ Says the Lord G od of hosts, “From all who are around you; And each of you will be driven out headlong, And there will be no one to gather the fugitives together. The captivity of the children of Ammon and restore their fortunes,” Says the L ord . Thus says the L ord of hosts, Has good counsel vanished from the intelligent and prudent? Has their wisdom decayed? When I inspect and punish him. Would they not leave some ungleaned grapes [on the vines]? If thieves came by night, Would they not destroy [only] what is enough [for them]? I have uncovered his hiding places And he cannot hide himself. His descendants have been destroyed along with his brothers (relatives) and his neighbors; And he is no more.

Though you make your nest as high as the eagle’s, I will bring you down from there,” says the L ord . “Hamath and Arpad are perplexed and shamed, For they have heard bad news; They are disheartened; Troubled and anxious like a [storm-tossed] sea Which cannot be calmed. She has turned away to flee, Terror (panic) has seized her; Anguish and distress have gripped her Like a woman in childbirth. The city of My joy!

From the four corners of heaven; And I will scatter them toward all those winds, And there will be no nation To which the outcasts of Elam will not go.

They have made them turn aside [to the seductive places of idolatry] on the mountains. They have gone along [from one sin to another] from mountain to hill; They have forgotten their [own] resting place. And their adversaries have said, ‘We are not guilty, Because they have sinned against the L ord [and are no longer holy to Him], their [true] habitation of righteousness and justice, Even the L ord , the [confident] hope of their fathers.’ And go out of the land of the Chaldeans; Be like the male goats [who serve as leaders] at the head of the flocks. An assembly of great nations from the north country. They will equip themselves and set up the battle lines against her; From there she will be taken captive. Their arrows will be like an expert warrior Who will not return empty-handed. All who plunder her will be satisfied,” says the L ord . O you who plunder My heritage, Though you are wanton and skip about like a heifer in the grass And neigh like stallions, She who gave you birth will be ashamed. Behold, she will be the least of the nations, A wilderness, a parched land and a desert. But she will be completely desolate; Everyone who goes by Babylon will be appalled And will hiss (mock) at all her wounds and plagues. All you archers. Shoot at her! Do not spare the arrows, For she has sinned against the L ord . She has given her hand [in agreement] and has surrendered; her pillars have fallen, Her walls have been torn down. For this is the vengeance of the L ord : Take vengeance on her; As she has done [to others], do to her. And the one who handles the sickle at the time of harvest. For fear of the sword of the oppressor Everyone will return to his own people And everyone will flee to his own land. Go up against it and against the people of Pekod (Punishment). Kill and utterly destroy them,” says the L ord , “And do everything that I have commanded you.” And [the noise of] great destruction. Is crushed and broken! How Babylon has become A horror [of desolation] among the nations! And you did not know it; You have been found and also seized Because you have struggled against the L ord .” And has brought out [the nations who unknowingly are] the weapons of His indignation (wrath), For it is a work of the Lord G od of hosts In the land of the Chaldeans. Open her storehouses; Pile it up like heaps of rubbish. Burn and destroy her completely; Let nothing be left of her. Let them go down to the slaughter! Woe (judgment is coming) to the Chaldeans, for their day has come, The time of their punishment. Proclaiming in Zion the vengeance of the L ord our God, The vengeance [of the L ord against the Chaldeans] for [plundering and destroying] His temple. All those who bend the bow. Encamp against her on every side; Let no one from there escape. Repay her according to her actions; Just as she has done, do to her. For she has been proudly defiant and presumptuous against the L ord , Against the Holy One of Israel. And all her soldiers will be destroyed on that day,” says the L ord . Says the Lord G od of hosts, “For your day has come, The time when I will punish you. With no one to raise him up; And I will set fire to his cities And it will devour all who are around him.” “The children of Israel are oppressed, And the children of Judah as well; And all who took them captive have held them tightly, They have refused to let them go. He will most certainly plead their case and defend their cause So that He may bring rest to their land, But turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon. “And against the inhabitants of Babylon And against her princes (officials, civic rulers) and against her wise men (astrologers, religious rulers)! A sword against her mighty warriors, and they will be shattered and destroyed! And against all the foreign troops that are in her midst, And they will become [as weak and defenseless as] women! A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered! For it is a land of [worthless] idols, And they are mad over fearsome idols [those objects of terror in which they foolishly trust]. The ostriches also will live there, And it will never again be inhabited [with people] Or lived in from generation to generation. And Gomorrah and their neighboring cities,” says the L ord , “So no man will live there; Nor shall any son of man live there.” And a great nation and many kings Will be stirring from the remote parts of the earth. They are cruel and have no compassion. They sound like the roaring of the sea; They ride on horses, Every man equipped like a man [ready] for the battle Against you, O Daughter of Babylon. And his hands fall limp and helpless; Anguish has seized him, And agony like that of a woman in childbirth."

Nor let him rise up in his coat of armor. So do not spare her young men; Devote her entire army to destruction. And wounded in her streets.” By his God, the L ord of hosts, Though their land is full of sin and guilt Before the Holy One of Israel. Let every one of you save his life! Do not be destroyed in her punishment, For this is the time of the L ord ’ s vengeance; He is going to pay her what she has earned. Intoxicating all the earth. The nations drank her wine; Therefore the nations have gone mad. Wail for her [if you care to]! Get balm for her [incurable] pain; Perhaps she may be healed. Abandon her and let each [captive] return to his own country, For her guilt and judgment have reached to heaven And are lifted up to the very skies. Come and let us proclaim in Zion The work of the L ord our God! Because His purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it; For that is the vengeance of the L ord , vengeance [on Babylon] for [plundering and destroying] His temple. Post a strong blockade, Station the guards, Prepare the men for ambush! For the L ord has both purposed and done That which He spoke against the people of Babylon. Rich in treasures, Your end has come, And the line measuring your life is cut. “Surely I will fill you with men, as with [a swarm of] locusts [who strip the land clean], And they will lift up a song and shout of victory over you.” He established the world by His wisdom And stretched out the heavens by His understanding. And He causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain And brings out the wind from His storehouses. Every goldsmith is shamed by the cast images he has made; For his molten idols are a lie, And there is no breath [of life] or spirit in them. In the time of their inspection and punishment they will perish. For He is the Maker of all and the One who formed and fashioned all things, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance— The L ord of hosts is His name. For with you I shatter nations, With you I destroy kingdoms. With you I shatter the chariot and its driver, With you I shatter old man and youth, With you I shatter young man and virgin, With you I shatter the farmer and his yoke of oxen, And with you I shatter governors and commanders. O destroying mountain [conqueror of nations], Who destroys the whole earth,” declares the L ord , “I will stretch out My hand against you, And roll you down from the [rugged] cliffs, And will make you a burnt mountain (extinct volcano). Nor any rock for a foundation, Blow the trumpet among the nations! Dedicate the nations [for war] against her; Call against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against her; Cause the horses to come up like bristly locusts [with their wings not yet released from their cases]. The kings of Media, With their governors and commanders, And every land of their dominion. For the purposes of the L ord against Babylon stand, To make the land of Babylon A desolation without inhabitants. They remain in their strongholds. Their strength and power have failed; They are becoming [weak and helpless] like women. Their dwelling places are set on fire; And one messenger to meet another, That his city has been captured from end to end; And they have set the [great] marshes on fire, And the men of war are terrified. At the time it is being trampled and prepared; Yet in a little while the time of harvest will come for her.” He has set me down like an empty vessel. Like a monster he has swallowed me up, He has filled his belly with my delicacies; He has spit me out and washed me away. The inhabitant of Zion will say; And, “May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” Jerusalem will say. “Behold, I will plead your case And take full vengeance for you; I will dry up her sea and great reservoir And make her fountain dry. An object of horror (an astonishing desolation) and a hissing [of scorn and amazement], without inhabitants. They (the princes) will be growling like lions’ cubs. And make them drunk, that they may rejoice And may sleep a perpetual sleep And not wake up,” declares the L ord . Like rams together with male goats. And the praise of the whole earth been seized! How Babylon has become an astonishing desolation and an object of horror among the nations! She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves. A parched land and a desert, A land in which no one lives, And through which no son of man passes. And take out of his mouth what he has swallowed up [the stolen sacred articles and the captives of Judah and elsewhere]. The nations will no longer flow to him. Yes, the wall of Babylon has fallen down! And each of you [escape and] save yourself From the fierce anger of the L ord . And so that you are not afraid at the rumor that will be heard in the land— For the rumor shall come one year, And after that another rumor in another year, And violence shall be in the land, Ruler against ruler— When I will judge and punish the idols of Babylon; Her whole land will be perplexed and shamed, And all her slain will fall in her midst. Will shout and sing for joy over Babylon, Says the L ord . As also for Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen. Go away! Do not stay! Remember the L ord from far away, And let [desolate] Jerusalem come into your mind. Disgrace has covered our faces, For foreigners [from Babylon] have come Into the [most] sacred parts of the sanctuary of the L ord [even those places forbidden to all but the appointed priest]. “When I will judge and punish the idols [of Babylon], And throughout her land the mortally wounded will groan.” And though she should fortify her lofty stronghold, Yet destroyers will come on her from Me,” says the L ord . And [the sound] of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! And He will still her great voice [that hums with city life]. And the waves [of her conquerors] roar like great waters, The noise of their voices is raised up [like the marching of an army]. And her mighty warriors will be captured, Their bows are shattered; For the L ord is a God of [just] restitution; He will fully repay. Her governors and her commanders and her mighty warriors; They will sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up,” Says the King—the L ord of hosts is His name. And her high gates will be set on fire; The peoples will labor in vain, And the nations become exhausted [only] for fire [that will destroy their work].”"
