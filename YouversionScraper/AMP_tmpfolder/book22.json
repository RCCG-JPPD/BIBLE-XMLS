[I have worked in] the sun; it has left its mark on me. My mother&quot;s sons were angry with me; They made me keeper of the vineyards, But my own vineyard (my complexion) I have not kept.&apos; Where do you pasture your flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who is veiled Beside the flocks of your companions?&apos; O you fairest among women, Run along, follow the tracks of the flock, And pasture your young goats By the tents of the shepherds. My [favorite] mare among the chariots of Pharaoh. Your neck with strings of jewels.&apos; [Studded] with beads of silver.&apos; My perfume (Solomon) sent forth [his] fragrance [surrounding me].
